/**
 * CalendarView — registered top-level calendar overlay view.
 *
 * Thin host wrapper around the rich `CalendarSection`: CalendarSection owns the
 * prev/today/next nav, the day/week/month SegmentedControl, the "New" button,
 * the time/month/agenda grids, and the `EventEditorDrawer` — all instrumented
 * through `useAgentElement` so the floating chat can drive them. This wrapper
 * only owns the selection id the section reports back, and routes a
 * chat-about-event request through the shared `setActionNotice` affordance.
 *
 * `getPrimedEvent` returns `null`: there is no deep-link / widget prime cache in
 * this view yet, so CalendarSection resolves selected events from the loaded
 * feed only. That is the honest behavior — no fabricated cache.
