/**
 * Connector-neutral command catalog.
 *
 * The text command registry (`registry.ts`) describes what an agent can *do*
 * via slash commands; the catalog re-projects that registry, plus the app's
 * navigation surface, into a connector-neutral shape (`ConnectorCommand`) that
 * a connector (Discord, Telegram, …) maps onto its own native command surface.
 *
 * Each command declares a `target` discriminating where it executes:
 *   - `agent`    → the reconstructed command text is routed through the agent's
 *                  message pipeline (these come from the text command registry).
 *   - `navigate` → opens a destination in the Eliza app (settings, views, …);
 *                  `path` is the in-app deep link.
 *   - `client`   → GUI/TUI-only behavior that has no remote surface; connectors
 *                  filter these out (none are emitted for remote connectors).
 *
 * Options carry a fully-resolved `choices: string[]` (always an array, possibly
 * empty) so connectors never have to evaluate the registry's function-valued
 * choices themselves.
