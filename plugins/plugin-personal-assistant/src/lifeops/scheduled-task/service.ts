/**
 * Long-lived ScheduledTask runner singleton.
 *
 * Before this service existed, `processDueScheduledTasks` called
 * `createRuntimeScheduledTaskRunner` on every tick (every 60s). That call
 * rebuilds all five typed registries (gates, completion-checks, ladders,
 * anchors, consolidation), refreshes the channel-keys snapshot, and wires
 * a fresh `createProductionScheduledTaskDispatcher`. None of that work
 * varies tick-to-tick — the registries are populated at plugin init and
 * stay stable. Rebuilding them on a 1-minute cadence was wasteful and
 * inflated per-tick latency.
 *
 * The service builds the runner ONCE per runtime when
 * `ScheduledTaskRunnerService.start` is invoked by the elizaOS Service
 * lifecycle, caches it on the instance, and hands it out via
 * `getScheduledTaskRunner`. The `now` clock and `agentId` are still
 * accepted per call so the tick can pass its own `request.now` and the
 * scheduler stays deterministic in tests.
 *
 * Registration: see `plugin.ts` → `services: [...,
 * ScheduledTaskRunnerService]`.
