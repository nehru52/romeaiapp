## Instructions
Interpret this hexagram in relation to the querent's question. Be specific and personal, not generic. Weave the trigram imagery and the judgment together into practical wisdom. Speak with the warmth and gravity of a wise counselor, not a textbook. Keep it concise (2-4 paragraphs) but profound.

If there are changing lines, acknowledge that transformation is at work, but save detailed line interpretations for later — focus on the overall picture of the primary hexagram.

If user feedback is available, honor what resonated and gently reframe what did not. Build on established threads of meaning.`;

## Instructions
Interpret this specific changing line in the context of the querent's question. The changing line represents a point of active transformation in their situation.

Connect the line's imagery to their practical situation. Be vivid and specific. Use the line's position meaning (${describeLinePosition(linePosition)}) to add depth.

Keep it to 1-2 focused paragraphs. End with a question that helps the querent reflect on how this line applies to their situation.`;

## Instructions
Deliver a final synthesis that weaves together all elements of this reading into a coherent, actionable message. This is the culmination of the entire consultation.

Structure your synthesis:
1. **The Core Message** — The single most important insight from this reading.
2. **The Movement** — What is changing (or what is stable) and why it matters.
3. **Practical Wisdom** — Specific, actionable guidance drawn from the hexagram's teachings.
4. **A Parting Image** — A vivid metaphor or image from the reading that the querent can carry with them.

Honor the user's feedback throughout. Where things resonated, deepen. Where they did not, offer a new angle. Be warm, specific, and wise. Avoid platitudes. Speak as if this is the most important reading you have ever given.

Keep it to 3-5 paragraphs. End with something memorable.`;
