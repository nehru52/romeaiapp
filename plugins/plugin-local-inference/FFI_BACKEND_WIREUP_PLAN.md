# FFI Streaming Backend Wire-up — Status

Status (2026-05-19): **Steps A–E landed. Plus slot save/restore, prewarm,
and speculative decoding. The desktop FFI adapter is the default
text-generation path on desktop.** Vision describe (mmproj) and
parallel-slot resize remain on the subprocess `FFI runtime` fallback
because they require native C work in `eliza-llama-shim.c` that this
JS-only effort cannot deliver. `ffi-streaming-backend.ts` retirement (Step F)
stays blocked on those two parity items.

This doc is now a status record + a follow-up backlog. The original
implementation plan is preserved at the bottom for archival.

## What's shipped

### Backend selection + dispatcher

- **`backend-selector.ts`** — `selectBackend()` returns `"ffi-streaming"`
  on desktop when `ffiSupported` is true. `ELIZA_INFERENCE_BACKEND=http`
  is the explicit opt-out. No `=ffi` opt-in flag — FFI is the default.
- **`backend.ts`** — `LocalInferenceBackend` interface has 12 optional
  methods covering everything `engine.ts` previously called directly on
  the `mtpLlamaServer` singleton. `BackendDispatcher` has matching
  forwarders that throw actionable "active backend (X) does not
  implement Y" errors when the active backend lacks a feature.
- **`backend.ts`** — `BackendDispatcher` accepts `ffiStreaming` +
  `probeFfiActive` constructor params. The engine wires them with the
  desktop FFI runtime + a probe that checks dylib disk presence + the
  `ELIZA_INFERENCE_BACKEND` env opt-out.

### Engine call-site refactor

- **`engine.ts`** — every direct `mtpLlamaServer.X(...)` call (16
  sites, including vision describe, slot persistence, prewarm,
  parallel-resize, drafter introspection) now routes through
  `this.dispatcher.X(...)`. The only remaining reference to the
  singleton in `engine.ts` is the dispatcher constructor.

### Desktop FFI adapter

- **`services/desktop-llama-adapter.ts`** — bun:ffi adapter for the
  desktop `libllama.{dylib,so,dll}` + `libeliza-llama-shim.{dylib,so,dll}`
  pair. Mirrors the verified AOSP adapter pattern with desktop-specific
  path resolution (`$ELIZA_STATE_DIR/local-inference/bin/mtp/<platform>-<arch>-<backend>/`).
  Exposes:
  - Model + ctx load via shim params (pointer-style, since llama.cpp's
    `_default_params` returns struct-by-value).
  - `tokenize(text): Int32Array` via direct `llama_tokenize` bind.
  - `LlmStreamingBinding` implementation: open / prefill / next / cancel
    / close sessions, one sampler chain per session, KV-clear-between-
    sessions guard (mirrors the AOSP `hasDecoded` gate that avoids the
    fresh-ctx segv).
  - `saveSlot` / `restoreSlot` via direct `llama_state_seq_save_file`
    / `_load_file` bind (no shim wrapper needed — both are pointer-style
    upstream).
  - **Speculative decoding**: `attachDrafter()` loads + attaches a
    drafter model via the shim's `eliza_llama_context_attach_drafter`,
    sets spec_mode via `eliza_llama_context_set_spec_mode`, and routes
    decode through `eliza_llama_decode_unified`. Per-step
    `drafterDrafted` / `drafterAccepted` counters populated by diffing
    the `eliza_llama_mtp_stats` block before/after each step.

### Desktop runtime

- **`services/desktop-ffi-backend-runtime.ts`** — production
  `FfiBackendRuntime` impl. `supported()` does a cheap disk probe;
  `acquire(plan)` loads dylibs, mmaps the model, resolves the drafter
  path from `plan.catalog.runtime.mtp.drafterModelPath`, and returns
  the session; `release()` tears everything down (drafter first, then
  main ctx, then model — same order the shim's lifetime rules expect).

### FFI streaming backend

- **`services/ffi-streaming-backend.ts`** — implements
  `LocalInferenceBackend` over the runtime. Exposes:
  - `generate` (text-only, calls the runner's `generateWithUsage`)
  - `persistConversationKv` / `restoreConversationKv` — forward to the
    binding's `llmStreamSaveSlot` / `RestoreSlot` with a per-conversation
    filename (`<conversationId>__slot<slotId>.kv`).
  - `prewarmConversation` — pure JS, runs the runner with `maxTokens=0`
    to feed the prompt without generating. The runner's `slotInFlight`
    serializes concurrent prewarms against the same cacheKey.
  - `drafterEnabled` / `loadedDrafterModelPath` — reports whether the
    catalog declared a drafter for the active session.
  - Deliberately no `embed`, `describeImage`, `resizeParallel` — the
    dispatcher's forwarders throw actionable errors when those are
    called against an FFI session (parity work tracked below).

### Narrow `LlmStreamingBinding` interface

- **`services/llm-streaming-binding.ts`** — narrow 8-method contract the
  runner consumes. `wrapElizaInferenceFfi(ffi)` adapter promotes the
  optional libelizainference surface to the required-shape narrow
  contract. The desktop adapter implements it directly.

### MLX

- **`mlx-server.ts` deleted outright**. No production caller ever
  invoked the spawn+HTTP path. Eligibility helpers stay where they were;
  `mlxBackendEligible()` returns `eligible: false` with a reason citing
  the missing in-process runtime. See `MLX_IN_PROCESS_PLAN.md`.

## Vision describe (mmproj/mtmd) — wired against mtmd ABI, opt-in build flag

**Status**: wired against the mtmd ABI; requires `ELIZA_ENABLE_VISION=1`
build flag; needs runtime smoke test against a real text GGUF + mmproj GGUF
before flipping default-on.

The shim now exposes the mtmd pointer-style wrappers (`eliza_mtmd_init`,
`eliza_mtmd_free`, `eliza_mtmd_default_marker`,
`eliza_mtmd_bitmap_init_rgb`, `eliza_mtmd_bitmap_init_from_buf`,
`eliza_mtmd_input_chunks_init`, `eliza_mtmd_tokenize`,
`eliza_mtmd_input_chunks_{size,get}`, `eliza_mtmd_input_chunk_{type,n_tokens}`,
`eliza_mtmd_encode_chunk`, `eliza_mtmd_output_embd`,
`eliza_mtmd_eval_chunks`, plus the matching `*_free` symbols), gated by
`#ifdef ELIZA_ENABLE_VISION` in `eliza_llama_shim.c`. Upstream llama.cpp HEAD removed the historical
`examples/llava/` path and consolidated multimodal under `tools/mtmd/`;
the shim targets that ABI exclusively.

The desktop dylib build script enables `LLAMA_BUILD_MTMD=ON` (in addition
to `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`) when `ELIZA_ENABLE_VISION=1` is set in the
build env, builds the `mtmd` cmake target, stages `libmtmd.<ext>` next to
`libllama.<ext>` in the output dir, and links the shim with `-lmtmd`. The
shim's rpath (`@loader_path` on darwin, `$ORIGIN` on linux) resolves
`libmtmd` at load time.

The TS adapter (`desktop-llama-adapter.ts`) has `bindVision()` that
returns null when the shim was compiled without the flag.
`DesktopLlamaAdapter.loadMmproj(mmprojPath)` calls `mtmd_init_from_file`
against the loaded text model. `describeImage(...)` now uses
`mtmd_helper_bitmap_init_from_buf` for image decode, `mtmd_tokenize` for
prompt+bitmap chunks, `mtmd_helper_eval_chunks` for multimodal KV prefill,
and the existing sampler/session loop for text generation.

**Default builds skip vision entirely.** No mtmd target, no shim
vision wrappers, `bindVision()` returns null, `describeImage` throws an
actionable "vision build flag not set" error. The subprocess
`FFI runtime` keeps the historical vision path for users who haven't
flipped the flag yet.

**To enable on a build host**:

```
ELIZA_ENABLE_VISION=1 bun run --cwd packages/app-core \
  scripts/build-llama-cpp-desktop-dylib.mjs --host
```

**Runtime contract**: the engine must pass `overrides.mmprojPath` on
`BackendPlan` when activating a vision-capable bundle. The runtime
records it on `FfiBackendSession.mmprojPath`; `describeImage` reads it
back and feeds the mtmd ctx with it lazily on first call.

**Remaining validation**: run a runtime smoke test against a known mmproj
GGUF on a host built with `ELIZA_ENABLE_VISION=1`. The default build remains
vision-off until that hardware/mmproj coverage is in place.

## What's still on the subprocess `FFI runtime` fallback

Nothing functional. Embeddings (`embed`) are still subprocess-only
because the kernel-required embedding model surface lives in
`ffi-streaming-backend.ts` — but that's a separate Eliza-specific kernel that
won't be FFI-bound for compatibility reasons. Calling `dispatcher.embed`
against an FFI session throws the existing
`"Active backend does not implement embed"` error.

## Done since the original plan

- **Parallel-slot resize** — DONE. Adapter now has a `ctxPool: Pointer[]`
  with per-ctx `hasDecodedFlags` and `drafterAttached` tracking arrays.
  `resizeParallel(N)` allocates (or frees) ctx instances against the
  same loaded model. Sessions pin to a specific ctx via
  `config.slotId % pool.length`. Drafter is per-ctx, attached lazily
  on first session that requests it on that ctx. The shared drafter
  model is loaded once and reused across ctxs.
  Wired through:
  - `DesktopLlamaAdapter.resizeParallel(N)` / `.parallelSlots()`
  - `DesktopFfiBackendRuntime.resizeParallel` / `.parallelSlots`
  - `FfiBackendRuntime` interface (optional methods)
  - `FfiStreamingBackend.resizeParallel` / `.parallelSlots`
  - The dispatcher's `resizeParallel` forwarder routes here when the
    FFI backend is active; engine's `maybeAutoResizeParallel` (which
    already called through the dispatcher) gets the new behavior for free.

---

## Step F — retire `ffi-streaming-backend.ts`

Blocked on vision + parallel-resize parity above. Once both are
implemented in the shim + adapter, the file can be deleted via:

1. Confirm no remaining `mtpLlamaServer.X` references in `engine.ts`
   (already true — refactor done).
2. Relocate the ~50 utility exports `ffi-streaming-backend.ts` provides to other
   files (catalog reads, env helpers, etc — these are non-transport
   utilities that happen to live in the same file).
3. Delete the file + remove the dispatcher constructor arg.
4. Remove the `ELIZA_INFERENCE_BACKEND=http` opt-out from the engine's
   probe (no subprocess to fall back to).

Estimated total work to land Step F once vision + resize parity exist:
~1 focused day of JS + a careful soak period.

## Risk register (updated)

| Risk | Mitigation status |
|---|---|
| Silent vision/slot failures when FFI active | ✅ Dispatcher throws actionable errors; slot save/restore now landed (subprocess fallback for vision only) |
| Tokenizer mismatch produces gibberish | ⚠️ Runtime vocab-size assertion is still absent in the adapter. Mitigated in practice by the engine loading one model at a time. |
| Concurrent dispatcher + direct-singleton paths racing | ✅ Eliminated by engine.ts refactor |
| Default flip exposed before parity | ✅ Vision + resize automatically fall to subprocess via dispatcher throw; users can set `ELIZA_INFERENCE_BACKEND=http` for full subprocess mode |
| Runtime correctness of the desktop adapter | ⚠️ The adapter follows the AOSP pattern 1:1 but has not been runtime-tested against `libllama.dylib` in this environment (cmake OOMs). The user/CI needs to build the dylibs and exercise the path before declaring this production-ready. |
