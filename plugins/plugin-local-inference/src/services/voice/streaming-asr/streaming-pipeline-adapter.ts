/**
 * Streaming-ASR pipeline adapter (item A1 / W7).
 *
 * The base `VoicePipeline` in `voice/pipeline.ts` drives a `StreamingTranscriber`
 * as a batch: it pushes the WHOLE VAD-gated utterance buffer in a single
 * `feed()` call, awaits `flush()`, and only then splits the final transcript
 * into tokens for the drafter/verifier loop. That works for the fused
 * batch decoder, but it leaves the biggest
 * H2 UX seam (incremental partials → planner / barge-in word-confirm /
 * speculative-on-pause) untapped when the fused build is in streaming mode.
 *
 * Rather than rewrite `pipeline.ts` (the Phase 0/1 agent owns it), this
 * module is a small WRAPPER the engine bridge can use to deliver PCM
 * chunks to a `StreamingTranscriber` as they arrive from the mic / VAD,
 * surface every `partial` event to the turn controller via `onPartial`,
 * and only finalize on `speech-end`. Behind a flag — when the fused
 * library advertises `asrStreamSupported() === false` or the flag is off
 * the caller keeps using `VoicePipeline.transcribeAll` exactly as today.
 *
 * Integration point (documented for the Phase 0/1 agent so they can wire
 * it without merge friction):
 *
 *   1. `EngineVoiceBridge` decides whether streaming is available via
 *      `pickStreamingMode({ ffi, asrBundlePresent, flag })`. When the
 *      mode is `"streaming"`, the bridge constructs `StreamingAsrFeeder`
 *      once per turn (passing the same transcriber that would have been
 *      handed to `VoicePipeline`) and routes mic PCM frames through
 *      `feeder.feedFrame(frame)` instead of buffering them.
 *   2. The feeder forwards every transcriber `partial` event to
 *      `onPartial(update)`. When VAD reports `speech-end` the caller
 *      calls `await feeder.finalize()`; the returned `TranscriptUpdate`
 *      is the final and is used to seed the drafter/verifier loop exactly
 *      as before (`splitTranscriptToTokens(final.partial, 0, final.tokens)`).
 *   3. The batch path (`VoicePipeline.transcribeAll`) is unchanged for
 *      every other adapter — there is no fork in `pipeline.ts` itself.
 *
 * This file is intentionally small and side-effect-free so it can land
 * during the merge window without touching files other agents own.

 * LocalAgreementBuffer — word-level streaming-ASR partial stabilizer.
 *
 * Streaming ASR emits a fresh word-sequence hypothesis on every audio
 * frame. Individual words near the end of the hypothesis can change
 * across frames ("sat" → "cap" → "sat") before settling. This buffer
 * applies LocalAgreement-n (n=2 default) at the word level: a word is
 * emitted to downstream only when it appears at the same position in n
 * consecutive hypotheses. The committed stable prefix is monotonically
 * non-decreasing — once a word is committed it is never retracted.
 *
 * Word-level (not character-level): suited for the VAD pipeline adapter
 * where downstream consumers (drafter, verifier) operate on word tokens.
 * For the character-level prefix variant, see `partial-stabilizer.ts`.
 * ==================================================================== */
