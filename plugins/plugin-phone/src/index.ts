/**
 * Public entry for @elizaos/plugin-phone.
 *
 * Two surfaces ship in this package:
 *  - The Android phone overlay (dialer, recent-calls, contacts pane) backed
 *    by `@elizaos/capacitor-phone`.
 *  - The Phone Companion — Capacitor pairing + chat-mirror + remote-session
 *    surface that runs alongside (or in place of) the desktop UI.
 *
 * Both surfaces are exported from the package barrel; hosts choose what they
 * render without importing package subpaths.
