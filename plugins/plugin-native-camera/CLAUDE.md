# @elizaos/capacitor-camera

Capacitor plugin that gives Eliza agents camera preview, photo capture, and video recording across web, iOS, and Android.

## Purpose / role

This package is a [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) plugin, not a standard elizaOS runtime plugin. It exposes a unified `Camera` object backed by platform-native implementations (Swift on iOS, Kotlin on Android) and a `CameraWeb` fallback that uses the browser's `MediaDevices` API. It is loaded by registering it with `@capacitor/core` under the plugin name `"ElizaCamera"`. It does not export an elizaOS `Plugin` object and is not auto-enabled by the elizaOS runtime — consuming apps must wire it up via Capacitor's plugin registry.

## Plugin surface

This is a Capacitor plugin, not an elizaOS action/provider/evaluator plugin. The exported API surface is:

| Export | File | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Camera` | `src/index.ts` | Capacitor plugin instance (registered as `"ElizaCamera"`) |
| `CameraWeb` | `src/web.ts` | Web fallback implementation (`WebPlugin` subclass) |
| All types | `src/definitions.ts` | TypeScript interfaces and types for the full plugin API |

### `CameraPlugin` interface methods (from `src/definitions.ts`)

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `getDevices()` | List available camera devices with capabilities |
| `startPreview(options)` | Start live preview into a DOM element |
| `stopPreview()` | Stop preview and release camera resources |
| `switchCamera(options)` | Switch to a different camera device or direction |
| `capturePhoto(options?)` | Capture a still photo as base64 from the active preview |
| `startRecording(options?)` | Start video recording (with optional audio, bitrate, duration/size limits) |
| `stopRecording()` | Stop recording and return a `VideoResult` with blob URL and metadata |
| `getRecordingState()` | Poll current recording duration and file size |
| `getSettings()` | Read current camera settings (flash, zoom, focus, exposure, white balance) |
| `setSettings(options)` | Apply partial `CameraSettings` update |
| `setZoom(options)` | Set zoom level (1.0 = no zoom; clamped to device max) |
| `setFocusPoint(options)` | Set manual focus point (x, y normalized 0–1) |
| `setExposurePoint(options)` | Set manual exposure point (x, y normalized 0–1) |
| `checkPermissions()` | Read current permission state without prompting |
| `requestPermissions()` | Trigger OS permission dialogs for camera + microphone |

### Events (via `addListener`)

| Event name | Payload type | Fired when |
|---|---|---|
| `"frame"` | `CameraFrameEvent` | Each video frame (timestamp, width, height) |
| `"error"` | `CameraErrorEvent` | Recording or stream error (code + message) |
| `"recordingState"` | `VideoRecordingState` | Recording started, periodic update, or stopped |

## Layout

```
plugins/plugin-native-camera/
  src/
    index.ts          — Registers the Capacitor plugin; exports `Camera` and all types
    definitions.ts    — All TypeScript interfaces (CameraPlugin, CameraDevice, PhotoResult, VideoResult, CameraSettings, ...)
    web.ts            — CameraWeb: MediaDevices API implementation for browser runtime
    web.test.ts       — Vitest unit tests for the CameraWeb implementation

      CameraPlugin.kt      — Camera2 API-based native Android implementation

  ElizaosCapacitorCamera.podspec  — CocoaPods spec for iOS distribution
  rollup.config.mjs               — Bundles dist/plugin.js (IIFE) and dist/plugin.cjs.js

```

## Commands

Only scripts defined in `package.json`:

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-camera build   # clean + tsc + rollup bundle
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-camera clean   # remove dist/
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-camera watch   # tsc --watch
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-camera test    # run vitest unit tests
```

`prepublishOnly` runs `build` automatically before `npm publish`.

## Config / env vars

This plugin reads no environment variables and has no elizaOS config keys. Camera and microphone permission state is managed by the OS; call `checkPermissions()` / `requestPermissions()` at runtime.

Capacitor plugin registration name: `"ElizaCamera"` (used internally by `@capacitor/core`).

## How to extend

### Add a new method to the plugin API

1. Declare the method signature in `src/definitions.ts` on the `CameraPlugin` interface.
2. Implement it in `src/web.ts` on `CameraWeb` (browser path).
3. Implement it in `ios/Sources/CameraPlugin/CameraPlugin.swift` (iOS).
4. Implement it in `android/src/main/java/ai/eliza/plugins/camera/CameraPlugin.kt` (Android).
5. Re-export any new types from `src/index.ts` if needed (it re-exports everything from `definitions.ts`).

### Add a new event

1. Add an `addListener` overload to `CameraPlugin` in `src/definitions.ts` with the new event name and payload type.
2. Call `this.notifyListeners("eventName", payload)` in `CameraWeb` (web) and the equivalent Capacitor bridge call in the native implementations.

## Conventions / gotchas

- **Not an elizaOS runtime plugin.** There is no `Plugin` object with actions/providers/services. Capacitor plugins are loaded by the Capacitor runtime, not the elizaOS plugin loader.
- **Web permission flow.** `startPreview()` calls `getUserMedia()` directly, which triggers the browser/OS dialog implicitly. Native permission probing is handled outside this Capacitor web fallback.
- **Web flash/torch.** The `MediaDevices` API does not expose torch control on web. `hasFlash` is inferred from `MediaTrackCapabilities.torch`; it will always be `false` on most desktop browsers.
- **Video mime type selection.** `CameraWeb` tries `video/webm;codecs=vp9,opus` → `vp8,opus` → `video/webm` → `video/mp4` in order. `stopRecording()` returns a `blob:` URL, not a file path.
- **Manual focus/exposure on web.** `setFocusPoint` and `setExposurePoint` throw if the device does not report `"manual"` in its `focusMode`/`exposureMode` capabilities — which is the case for most desktop webcams.
- **Build output.** `tsc` compiles to `dist/esm/`; rollup then bundles into `dist/plugin.js` (IIFE for browser script tag) and `dist/plugin.cjs.js` (CJS). The `exports` field in `package.json` points bun/dev builds directly at `src/index.ts`.
- **iOS deployment target:** iOS 15.0+, Swift 5.9. Depends on `AVFoundation`, `Photos`, and `UIKit`.
- **Android:** Kotlin implementation under `ai.eliza.plugins.camera`.
- See root `AGENTS.md` for repo-wide conventions (logger, ESM, naming, architecture rules).
