/**
 * Interruption decider for sub-agents sharing a task room.
 *
 * When a human posts in a task room while sub-agents are working, we must
 * decide — per participant — whether that message should INTERRUPT the
 * in-flight turn, be QUEUED for after it, be DELIVERED now (idle agent), or be
 * IGNORED (ambient chatter not meant for this agent).
 *
 * Eliza participants already have this faculty: the core `shouldRespond`
 * evaluator (RESPOND / IGNORE / STOP). Coding sub-agents (Claude Code, Codex,
 * OpenCode) have no such gate — left alone, every keystroke in the room is
 * injected into a running turn, derailing it. This module gives them an
 * equivalent structural decision, and threads an Eliza participant's
 * `shouldRespond` verdict through unchanged when one is supplied.
 *
 * Bias: a working sub-agent keeps working. We only INTERRUPT on an explicit
 * stop/redirect; otherwise relevant messages QUEUE and ambient ones are IGNORE.
