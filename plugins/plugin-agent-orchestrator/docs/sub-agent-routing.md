# Sub-agent routing

> Canonical orchestration path for ACP sub-agents. ACP-spawned sessions route
> through `AcpService` and `SubAgentRouter`.

## Goals

1. **Origin tracking.** When the main agent spawns a sub-agent in response to
   a user message in room R, the sub-agent's terminal output (`task_complete`,
   `error`, `blocked`) lands back in room R, addressed appropriately.
2. **Main-agent-in-the-loop.** When a sub-agent reports done, the **main
   agent** — not a separate coordinator — decides whether to:
   - reply to the user (sub-agent finished, here's the result),
   - reply to the sub-agent via `SEND_TO_AGENT` (proof not satisfying; keep
     going),
   - or both in one turn.
3. **Cache friendliness.** Sub-agent updates should not invalidate the
   stable provider/system prefix on every event.

## Components

### `AcpService`

Spawn surface. TASKS op=create records origin context in
`session.metadata` at spawn time:

```ts
{
  messageId: message.id,    // parent message UUID
  roomId:    taskRoomId,    // task-owner room, defaults to message.roomId
  originRoomId: message.roomId,
  taskRoomId,
  worktreeRoomId,
  swarmRooms: [
    { roomId: taskRoomId, roles: ["task"] },
    { roomId: worktreeRoomId, roles: ["worktree"] },
  ],
  worldId:   message.worldId,
  userId:    message.entityId,
  label,
  source:    content.source,
}
```

### `SubAgentRouter` (`services/sub-agent-router.ts`)

Subscribes to `AcpService.onSessionEvent`. On `task_complete`, `error`, or
`blocked` (boundary events only — not streaming chunks), it:

1. Reads `session.metadata` for origin and swarm-room keys.
2. Constructs a synthetic `Memory` with:
   - `entityId` = a deterministic per-session sub-agent UUID derived locally
     via SHA1 of `<runtime.agentId>:acpx:sub-agent:<sessionId>` (no runtime
     dependency on `@elizaos/core`'s `createUniqueUuid` so the router stays
     type-only on core),
   - `agentId`  = `runtime.agentId`,
   - `roomId`   = the selected swarm target room,
   - `content.source` = `"sub_agent"`,
   - `content.inReplyTo` = origin `messageId`,
   - `content.metadata.subAgent*` carries the structured event
     (`subAgentSessionId`, `subAgentLabel`, `subAgentEvent`,
     `subAgentStatus`, `subAgentAgentType`, `subAgentRoundTrip`,
     `subAgentRoundTripCap`, `subAgentCapExceeded`, `originUserId`,
     `originMessageId`, `originSource`).
   - `content.metadata.subAgentRoutingKind`,
     `subAgentTargetRoomId`, `subAgentTargetRoomRole`,
     `subAgentTargetRoomRoles`, `taskRoomId`, `worktreeRoomId`, and
     `subAgentSwarmRooms` tell the main agent why this memory landed in
     this room and which other swarm room(s) exist for the task.
3. Delivers via `runtime.messageService.handleMessage(runtime, memory, callback)`,
   which also persists the memory. If `messageService` is unavailable, it
   falls back to `runtime.createMemory(..., "messages")` plus
   `MESSAGE_RECEIVED`.

For platform-originated tasks, the router builds a short-lived callback from
`runtime.sendMessageToTarget` so the planner's answer can return to the same
selected swarm room.

#### Why only boundary events

Streaming events (`agent_message_chunk`, `tool_running`, `ready`) would
re-fire the planner constantly and burn the prompt cache. Live status is
exposed via the provider instead. The router is the channel for events
that warrant an action decision.

#### Dedup / idempotency

Events are deduped in-memory by
`<sessionId>|<event>|<status>|<short hash of payload>`. Same sub-agent
re-emitting the same `task_complete` payload posts once. A different
response payload posts again — that's "the sub-agent did more work and
reported a new state".

Swarm target rooms are also normalized before posting. `taskRoomId` is first,
`worktreeRoomId` is second, duplicate room IDs collapse into one target, and
the collapsed target keeps both roles (`["task", "worktree"]`). That means a
task room that is also the worktree coordination room gets one useful message
rather than two identical messages with ambiguous purpose.

#### Routing kinds

Most terminal events use `subAgentRoutingKind: "TASK_STATUS"` and fan out to
the normalized task/worktree swarm rooms. Two explicit coordination events are
targeted:

- `QUESTION_FOR_TASK_CREATOR` routes only to the task room and carries
  `subAgentTargetRoomRole: "task"`.
- `AGENT_COORDINATION` routes to the worktree room when present, otherwise the
  task room, and carries the selected target role.

`blocked` events default to `QUESTION_FOR_TASK_CREATOR` because the sub-agent
is waiting on human or parent-agent input.

#### Disable switch

`ACPX_SUB_AGENT_ROUTER_DISABLED=1` keeps the service registered but unbound
(useful for tests, headless backfills, or staging where you want spawning
without runtime injection).

#### Round-trip cap

To prevent ping-pong loops where the main agent and a sub-agent endlessly
ask each other to keep going, the router tracks per-session inject count.
When the count exceeds `ACPX_SUB_AGENT_ROUND_TRIP_CAP` (default 32) the
router force-stops the session and emits a single
`round_trip_cap_exceeded` memory carrying `subAgentRoundTrip`,
`subAgentRoundTripCap`, and `subAgentCapExceeded: true`. Subsequent events
from the same capped session are suppressed.

Set `ACPX_SUB_AGENT_ROUND_TRIP_CAP=N` in the runtime config to override.
The default of 32 is generous; a typical sub-agent task hits 1–5
round-trips before terminal completion.

### `activeSubAgentsProvider` (`providers/active-sub-agents.ts`)

Cache-friendly view of live sub-agent sessions. Filters to:

- sessions whose `metadata.roomId` is set (i.e. routed by `createTaskAction`),
- sessions not in a terminal status (`stopped`, `completed`, `error`,
  `errored`, `cancelled`).

The text is **structural only** — id, label, agentType, bucketed status,
last two workdir segments. No timestamps, no message excerpts. Sorted by
`sessionId` so the rendered text is byte-stable across turns when the
active set is unchanged.

Status bucketing: `ready`, `running`, `busy`, `tool_running`, and
`authenticating` all collapse to the literal string `"active"` in the
provider text. `blocked` is preserved as a distinct value (the planner
needs to know a session is waiting for input). Terminal statuses
(`stopped`, `completed`, `error`, `errored`, `cancelled`) cause the
session to be filtered out entirely. This keeps the cached provider
segment byte-identical across transient status flips like
`ready → tool_running → ready`, which would otherwise invalidate the
prefix cache on every tool call.

This is the live status channel. The synthetic Memory posted by the router
is the per-event channel.

### Action set

The main agent's planner sees:

- **`REPLY`** (from the bootstrap action set) — replies to the user in
  current room.
- **`SEND_TO_AGENT { sessionId, text }`** — pushes a follow-up to a
  live sub-agent. Use when the sub-agent's proof is unsatisfying or it
  asked a clarifying question.
- **`STOP_AGENT { sessionId }`** — terminates. Use when the sub-agent's
  output is clearly final and you don't want it idling.
- **`ACPX_CREATE_TASK`** — spawn additional sub-agents.

Multi-action plans (e.g. `[REPLY, SEND_TO_AGENT]`) are supported by the
planner and execute sequentially in one turn.

## Cache discipline

Anthropic prompt caching breaks at segment boundaries (see
`plugin-anthropic/models/text.ts`). The plugin marks providers and action
examples as `stable: true`. Sub-agent flow is designed around this:

- **Stable prefix (cached):** system prompt, character bio, action examples,
  active-sub-agents provider text (structural only, sorted, deterministic).
- **Volatile suffix (re-tokenized):** the sub-agent's synthetic message
  text (the per-event narration).

Each new sub-agent event invalidates only the message tail. The provider
text changes only when a session enters or leaves the active set, not on
every chunk.

A per-session router invocation is one cache-miss tail; everything before
the most recent turn stays warm.

## Loop safety

- The router emits **inbound** memories with `entityId` set to the
  sub-agent's pseudo-UUID (not `runtime.agentId`), so the runtime processes
  them as messages from another entity, not as the agent's own outputs.
- The main agent's reply via `SEND_TO_AGENT` does not directly trigger a
  new `task_complete`. The sub-agent has to actually do work first, which
  bounds re-entry.
- Dedup prevents accidental double-injection from event re-emission.
- The round-trip cap (above) is the hard ceiling for ping-pong loops.

## ACP Boundary

`plugin-agent-orchestrator` has a single task-agent transport: `AcpService`.
There is no PTY/coordinator fallback path.

Autonomous follow-up decisions are handled by the main agent's normal action
selection over the synthetic Memory emitted by `SubAgentRouter`.

## Testing

- `__tests__/unit/sub-agent-router.test.ts` — origin tracking, dedup,
  streaming-event filtering, disable switch, error narration, fallback
  emit, unsubscribe.
- `__tests__/unit/active-sub-agents.test.ts` — origin filtering, terminal
  exclusion, deterministic sort, no volatile fields, action-hint text.
