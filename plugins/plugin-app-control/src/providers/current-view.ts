/**
 * Current-view acknowledgement provider.
 *
 * Carries two related signals into the prompt:
 *  - **Ambient state** — the view the user is currently looking at, so replies
 *    stay aware of where they are ("the user is currently viewing Settings").
 *  - **Just-switched acknowledgement** — when a switch just happened (or is
 *    *about* to happen this turn), the text is phrased so the agent acknowledges
 *    the move in its reply ("opening your calendar now").
 *
 * Same-turn acknowledgement for explicit commands is the hard case: at
 * response-compose time the server still reports the *previous* view because the
 * VIEWS action has not executed yet. We detect the imminent switch the same
 * deterministic way the early shortcut does — `resolveIntentView(message.text)`
 * — and phrase forward-looking. Already-executed switches (the contextual
 * evaluator, or a prior turn's action) are caught via the server `justSwitched`
 * stamp. Reads the live server state over loopback (GET /api/views/current).
 *
 * This provider is intentionally NOT `alwaysInResponseState`: it is injected
 * into the Stage-1 response state only on switch turns by the
 * `compose_state_providers` hook (see `index.ts`), so non-switch turns pay no
 * extra prompt/token cost.
