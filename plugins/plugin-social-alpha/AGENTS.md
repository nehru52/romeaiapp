# @elizaos/plugin-social-alpha

Tracks token recommendations (shills/FUD) in chat, builds trust scores per recommender based on P&L outcomes, and injects leaderboard intelligence into agent context.

## Purpose / role

This plugin listens to every incoming message, uses an LLM to extract crypto buy/sell recommendations, stores them against the sender's trust profile, and periodically evaluates whether following those calls would have been profitable. It exposes a provider that gives the agent real-time trust scores and leaderboard data so the agent can weigh advice from different users.

Loaded as `socialAlphaPlugin` (default export). Add it to an agent's `plugins` array — it is opt-in, not auto-enabled.

## Plugin surface

| Kind | Name | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| Service | `CommunityInvestorService` | Core engine: token data fetching, trust score calculation, position/recommendation storage, leaderboard assembly |
| Provider | `socialAlpha` | Injects sender's trust profile + leaderboard summary into agent context (dynamic; gated to `finance` / `crypto` / `social_posting` contexts via `contextGate`) |
| Event handler | `MESSAGE_RECEIVED` | Extracts buy/sell signals from incoming messages via a single combined LLM call; writes recommendations to the sender's component; enqueues `PROCESS_TRADE_DECISION` tasks |
| Routes | `GET /api/social-alpha/leaderboard` | Returns `LeaderboardEntry[]` as JSON via `CommunityInvestorService.getLeaderboardData` |
| View | `social-alpha` | Leaderboard view (`SocialAlphaView`, `dist/views/bundle.js`) — registered via `Plugin.views`, shown when the plugin is enabled; gates on a configured agent wallet |

No actions or evaluators are registered.

## Commands

Only scripts defined in this package's `package.json`:

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-social-alpha build       # tsup + view bundle + types → dist/
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-social-alpha test        # vitest run --passWithNoTests
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-social-alpha clean       # rm -rf dist .turbo node_modules
```

`lint`, `format`, and `typecheck` are real gates (biome + `tsc --noEmit`).

## Config / env vars

Read from `runtime.getSetting()` / `process.env`. All are declared in `package.json#agentConfig.pluginParameters`.

| Var | Required | Purpose |
|-----|----------|---------|
| `BIRDEYE_API_KEY` | Yes | Token price/security/trade data (Solana) |
| `DEXSCREENER_API_KEY` | Yes (declared) | DEX pair data, ticker resolution (declared in agentConfig but not actively read from settings in current code paths — DexscreenerClient uses no API key) |
| `HELIUS_API_KEY` | Yes | Solana token holder lists (optional at runtime — service degrades gracefully) |
| `JUPITER_API_KEY` | Yes (declared) | Jupiter swap quotes (not actively used in current code paths) |
| `COINGECKO_API_KEY` | Yes (declared) | CoinGecko data (not actively used in current code paths) |
| `MORALIS_API_KEY` | Yes (declared) | Moralis data (not actively used in current code paths) |

Plugin-level config keys (set in agent character or environment):

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `PROCESS_TRADE_DECISION_INTERVAL_HOURS` | `"1"` | How often PROCESS_TRADE_DECISION tasks run |
| `METRIC_REFRESH_INTERVAL_HOURS` | `"24"` | How often recommender metrics are refreshed |
| `USER_TRADE_COOLDOWN_HOURS` | `"12"` | Minimum hours between trade decisions per user |
| `SCAM_PENALTY` | `"-100"` | Trust score penalty for promoting a rug/scam |
| `SCAM_CORRECT_CALL_BONUS` | `"100"` | Trust score bonus for correctly calling out a scam |
| `MAX_RECOMMENDATIONS_IN_PROFILE` | `"50"` | Rolling window of recommendations kept per user |

## How to extend

**Add a new route:** append a `Route` object to the `communityInvestorRoutes` array in `src/routes.ts`.

**Add a new provider:** create `src/providers/<name>.ts` exporting a `Provider`, then add it to the `providers` array in `src/index.ts`.

**Add a new event handler:** add an entry to the `events` object in `src/events.ts` (keyed by elizaOS event name).

**Extend trust scoring:** the balanced scoring algorithm lives in `src/services/balancedTrustScoreCalculator.ts` (`calculateBalancedTrustScore`). Weights and components are isolated there; `CommunityInvestorService` instantiates it as `this.balancedTrustCalculator` and invokes `calculateBalancedTrustScore`. (The simpler private `CommunityInvestorService.calculateTrustScore` uses its own inline history/performance weights and does not call the balanced calculator.) Do not add business logic to the provider or routes.

## Conventions / gotchas

- **No actions.** All recommendation capture happens via the `MESSAGE_RECEIVED` event handler, not actions. The agent does not need to invoke anything explicitly.
- **Component storage.** Each user's trust profile is stored as an elizaOS Component of type `TRUST_MARKETPLACE_COMPONENT_TYPE` in a seeded world (`TRUST_LEADERBOARD_WORLD_SEED = "trust-leaderboard-world-v1"`). The world ID is deterministic per agent via `createUniqueUuid`.
- **Single LLM call per message.** Relevance checking and recommendation extraction are merged into one `TEXT_LARGE` call (`RELEVANCE_AND_EXTRACTION_TEMPLATE` in `events.ts`). An empty `recommendations` array means "not relevant" — both cases are handled identically.
- **Deduplication window.** Identical token+type recommendations within 30 minutes are dropped (`RECENT_REC_DUPLICATION_TIMEFRAME_MS`).
- **Frontend.** The leaderboard UI is a plugin view (`SocialAlphaView`) served at `/api/views/social-alpha/bundle.js`. Run `bun run build` so `dist/views/bundle.js` exists before the view can load. The view shows a wallet-required empty state until the agent wallet is configured.
- **`bignumber.js`** is used for precise arithmetic in price calculations (see `clients.ts`).
- See repo root `AGENTS.md` for architecture commandments, logger rules, and ESM conventions.
