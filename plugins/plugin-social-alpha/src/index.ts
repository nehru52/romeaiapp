/**
 * Social Alpha Plugin for ElizaOS.
 *
 * Tracks token recommendations ("shills") and criticisms ("FUD") made by
 * users in chat. Builds trust scores for each recommender based on whether
 * following their calls would have been profitable — accounting for:
 *
 *   - Buy calls that mooned vs dumped
 *   - Sell/FUD calls on tokens that were scams (good call) vs tokens that rallied (bad call)
 *   - Conviction level, recency, and consistency
 *
 * Exposes a **Social Alpha Provider** that injects trust data (win rate,
 * rank, P&L history) into the agent's context so it can weigh advice
 * from different users.
