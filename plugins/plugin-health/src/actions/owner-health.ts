/**
 * OWNER_HEALTH umbrella action (owner-facing) — extracted scaffold.
 *
 * MIGRATION STATUS: STUB.
 * TODO(migrate: plugins/plugin-lifeops/src/actions/health.ts)
 *
 * The full owner-facing health action — covering `today`, `trend`, `by_metric`,
 * and `status` subactions over the LifeOps owner-state + health-connector
 * service surface — will be ported here in a follow-up pass once the
 * scheduler / owner-state foundations land. For now this scaffold registers
 * the action name so the runtime can resolve it; the handler returns a typed
 * `scaffold_stub` failure pointing back at the source.
 *
 * Reference factory for the host-adapted form lives in
 * `plugins/plugin-health/src/actions/health.ts` (createOwnerHealthAction).
