# Android computer-use — constraints, capabilities, and validation checklist

## What works in a consumer APK

| Capability | Permission | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AccessibilityService — view tree + gesture dispatch | `BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE` (user must enable in Settings) | Survives Advanced Protection Mode in most OEM ROMs |
| MediaProjection — screen frame capture | `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROJECTION` + user consent dialog | 1 Hz default; foreground service required |
| UsageStatsManager — app history + foreground app | `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` (user must enable in Settings > Usage Access, no runtime prompt) | 24-hour window; 5-min scan for foreground app |
| Camera2 — JPEG/RGBA frames | `CAMERA` (runtime permission) | Service-friendly; no Activity or SurfaceView needed |
| onTrimMemory → MemoryArbiter pressure | None (ComponentCallbacks2) | Fires at TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_LOW and TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_CRITICAL |

## Pixel/Google Android assistant entry points

For normal Google Android and Play distribution, Eliza uses Google App
Actions and Android shortcuts only:

- `packages/app-core/platforms/android/app/src/main/res/xml/shortcuts.xml`
  declares `actions.intent.OPEN_APP_FEATURE`, `CREATE_MESSAGE`,
  and `GET_THING`.
- `OPEN_APP_FEATURE` is the static feature surface for chat/ask, voice,
  LifeOps daily brief, LifeOps task creation, and LifeOps tasks.
- `CREATE_MESSAGE` and `GET_THING` route free-form ask/chat text to the
  app's chat deep link.
- Static shortcuts use source-tagged deep links and are bound to
  `OPEN_APP_FEATURE` inline inventory.
- Each App Actions capability keeps a fallback fulfillment without a
  required parameter. The build validator rejects regressions because
  Assistant may invoke vague feature/search/message requests.
Unsupported BIIs such as `actions.intent.CREATE_THING` are intentionally
not declared; LifeOps task creation is a feature-open flow and any
mutation must still go through runtime confirmation and the ScheduledTask
path.

Mapping by flow:

| Flow | Supported App Actions / shortcut entry |
|---|---|
| Ask/chat | `CREATE_MESSAGE`, `GET_THING`, `eliza_app_action_chat` |
| Voice chat | `OPEN_APP_FEATURE` inline inventory, `eliza_app_action_voice` |
| LifeOps daily brief | `OPEN_APP_FEATURE` inline inventory, `eliza_app_action_daily_brief` |
| Create LifeOps task | `OPEN_APP_FEATURE` inline inventory, `eliza_app_action_new_task` |
| View LifeOps tasks | `OPEN_APP_FEATURE` inline inventory, `eliza_app_action_tasks` |

There is no Play-compatible default-assistant handoff for the Pixel build.
Normal Google Android entry goes through App Actions/static shortcuts/deep
links. AOSP-only `ROLE_ASSISTANT` and `ACTION_ASSIST` behavior stays out of
the Play build.

The Play-compatible `android-cloud` build must not request or expose
default-assistant/system-only powers. Keep `ACTION_ASSIST`,
`VOICE_COMMAND`, `ROLE_ASSISTANT`, `BIND_VOICE_INTERACTION`,
usage-stats appop permissions, SMS/call default-role components, boot
receivers, battery-optimization exemption, MediaProjection foreground
services, and special-use foreground services out of that build.
AOSP/default-assistant behavior belongs only to `android-system` or
sideload-only validation builds.

Current Android docs describe App Actions as `shortcuts.xml`
capabilities registered on the launcher activity; Gemini/Assistant
interoperability for general apps is through those App Actions and
shortcuts. The navigation-app Gemini/Assistant intent formats are
navigation-specific and are not a general personal-assistant integration
surface for this app.

## What requires a system-app build (AOSP flavor)

| Capability | Mechanism | Permission |
|---|---|---|
| High-fidelity screen capture | `SurfaceControl.captureDisplay()` | `READ_FRAME_BUFFER` (`signature|privileged`) |
| High-fidelity input injection | `InputManager.injectInputEvent()` | `INJECT_EVENTS` (`signature|privileged`) |
| Full process enumeration | `IActivityManager.getRunningAppProcesses()` via AIDL | `REAL_GET_TASKS` (`signature`) |

See `AOSP_SYSTEM_APP.md` for the privileged build path.

## Advanced Protection Mode caveat

When Advanced Protection Mode (APM) is active on Pixel 9+ and some OEM variants:

- AccessibilityService registered with `featureAccessibility` (not `featureGeneric`) survives.
  `ElizaAccessibilityService` is registered correctly.
- Third-party AccessibilityServices with broad event masks may be killed on APM devices
  even when re-enabled in Settings. If the service is repeatedly stopped, check `adb logcat`
  for `AccessibilityManagerService` or `android.safetycenter` entries.

## lmkd survival strategy

The Linux low-memory killer daemon (lmkd) uses oom_score_adj to prioritize kills.
Two mitigations are active:

1. `ScreenCaptureService` is a foreground service — lmkd ranks foreground services
   below cached apps; they survive until memory is critically exhausted.
2. `onTrimMemory` → `capacitorPressureSource.dispatch()` — WS1 MemoryArbiter receives
   the pressure signal and proactively unloads lower-priority model handles
   (transcribe, vision-describe) before the OOM killer fires.

## Manual on-device validation checklist

Run this against a physical Android device (API 24+ for gesture dispatch; API 29+ for
`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROJECTION`). Cuttlefish x86_64 emulator is acceptable for
smoke-testing, but the x86_64 JNI patch must be present (see WS4 llama-cpp-capacitor patch).

### 1. Permissions setup

- [ ] Install the APK and open the app.
- [ ] Grant `CAMERA` runtime permission when prompted.
- [ ] Navigate to Settings > Accessibility > Eliza > enable the service.
  Verify `ElizaAccessibilityService.instance` is non-null via:
  `adb shell dumpsys accessibility | grep -i eliza`
- [ ] Navigate to Settings > Digital Wellbeing (or Settings > Security > Usage Access)
  > Eliza > enable Usage Access.

### 2. AccessibilityService — view tree

```
adb shell am start com.example.app   # open any app
curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/api/computer-use/getAccessibilityTree
```
Expected: JSON array with `[{id, role, label, bbox, actions}]` entries.
Verify `role` values are Android class names (e.g. `android.widget.Button`).

### 3. Gesture dispatch

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/api/computer-use/dispatchGesture \
  -d '{"type":"tap","x":540,"y":960}'
```
Expected: `{"ok":true}` and the tap is visible on screen.

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/api/computer-use/dispatchGesture \
  -d '{"type":"swipe","x":540,"y":1600,"x2":540,"y2":400,"durationMs":400}'
```
Expected: `{"ok":true}` and the list scrolls up.

### 4. Global actions

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/api/computer-use/performGlobalAction -d '{"action":"home"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/api/computer-use/performGlobalAction -d '{"action":"recents"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/api/computer-use/performGlobalAction -d '{"action":"back"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/api/computer-use/performGlobalAction -d '{"action":"notifications"}'
```
Expected: each action is visually confirmed on device.

### 5. MediaProjection — screen capture

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/api/computer-use/startMediaProjection -d '{"fps":1}'
```
Expected: system consent dialog appears. Accept it.

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:1337/api/computer-use/captureFrame
```
Expected: `{ok:true, data:{jpegBase64:"...", width:..., height:..., timestampMs:...}}`.
Verify `jpegBase64` decodes to a valid JPEG of the current screen.

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/api/computer-use/stopMediaProjection
```
Expected: `{ok:true, data:{stopped:true}}`.

### 6. UsageStats — app enumeration

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:1337/api/computer-use/enumerateApps
```
Expected: JSON array of `{packageName, label, lastUsedMs, totalForegroundMs, isForeground}`.
Verify `isForeground:true` for the frontmost app.
If you receive `{ok:false, code:"permission_denied"}`, confirm Usage Access is enabled.

### 7. Camera capture

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/api/computer-use/startCamera -d '{"fps":1}'
```
Expected: `{ok:true, data:{cameras:"[...]"}}` with at least one camera entry.

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:1337/api/computer-use/captureFrameCamera
```
Expected: `{ok:true, data:{jpegBase64:"..."}}`.

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/api/computer-use/stopCamera
```

### 8. Memory pressure dispatch

Open a memory-intensive app or use `adb shell am send-trim-memory $(pidof ai.eliza.eliza) 80`
to simulate TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_CRITICAL.

Expected: the JS console (or logcat for bridge events) shows:
`[capacitorPressureSource] dispatching pressure: critical`
followed by MemoryArbiter eviction log entries.

Verify via `GET /api/training/auto/config` that arbiter pressure state transitions to `critical`.

### 9. App Actions / static shortcuts

Use a Play/Assistant-capable Pixel or Google Android device signed into
the same account used by the App Actions test tool.

- [ ] Confirm the launcher activity registers `@xml/shortcuts`:
  `aapt dump xmltree app-release.aab base/manifest/AndroidManifest.xml`.
- [ ] Confirm `shortcuts.xml` contains `OPEN_APP_FEATURE`,
  `CREATE_MESSAGE`, and `GET_THING`, with no unsupported
  `actions.intent.CREATE_THING`.
- [ ] Confirm generated shortcuts use the app package and URL scheme for
  the current brand; no `ai.elizaos.app`, `app.eliza`, or stale `eliza://`
  value should remain after rewriting.
- [ ] Trigger chat/ask, voice, new task, daily brief, and tasks from the Assistant
  preview. Expected: Eliza opens via a source-tagged deep link and any
  LifeOps mutation goes through the app/runtime `ScheduledTask` path.
