/**
 * Thin shim around `@capacitor/background-runner`.
 *
 * Why a shim and not a direct import:
 *  - The Capacitor plugin is an OPTIONAL peer. Server / desktop / web builds
 *    must not fail to load this plugin just because the native module isn't
 *    installed.
 *  - The Capacitor module is ESM-only and resolves a Capacitor `WebPlugin`
 *    that registers itself against `window`. Probing for it via dynamic
 *    `import()` keeps the dependency truly optional.
 *
 * The runtime contract for `@capacitor/background-runner`:
 *  - `BackgroundRunner.dispatchEvent({ label, event, details })` — fires a
 *    JS handler registered by the host app under
 *    `runners/<label>.js`. The native side wakes the JS context, runs the
 *    handler, then suspends.
 *  - Native registration of the iOS BGTaskScheduler identifier and Android
 *    WorkManager job lives in the Capacitor app's `Info.plist`,
 *    `AndroidManifest.xml`, and `capacitor.config.ts`. See INSTALL.md.
 *
 * This shim only exposes a presence check and a typed dispatch function. The
 * actual native scheduling is configured at app build time, not from JS.
