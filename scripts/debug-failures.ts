const SR_PROMPT = `Decide whether to respond to this message.

Respond (YES):
- The message directly addresses or mentions you
- The message asks a question or makes a request you can address
- The message is a general request for assistance or information with no specific addressee

Do not respond (NO):
- The message is addressed to someone else
- The message is purely gratitude, agreement, or acknowledgment with no request
- The message is only an emoji, punctuation, or ambient reaction
- The message is a social question not directed at you (e.g., "Anyone going to the party?")
- No response is expected or needed

Output exactly one token: either YES or NO, with no surrounding whitespace.`;

const AP_PROMPT = `Select the next action based on the conversation context.

Actions:
- REPLY: Send a text response (greetings, factual answers, questions, general chat)
- SEARCH: Look up information online (current events, product details, facts not in training)
- SCHEDULE: Create a calendar event — use when the user says "schedule", "book", "block", "meeting", "appointment", or "add to calendar"
- REMIND: Set a time-based alert — use when the user says "remind me", "reminder", or "alert me at [time]"
- NOTES: Save information for later — use when the user says "note", "jot down", "remember", or captures an idea
- NONE: No response needed

NONE applies when the message is: emoji-only, single punctuation, pure reaction ("lol", "ok", "👍", "..."), or acknowledgment with no follow-up request.
Default to REPLY when no other action clearly fits.

Return ONLY this JSON (no extra whitespace):
{"toolCalls":[{"name":"ACTION_NAME","args":{}}]}

No explanation. JSON only.`;

const FACT_PROMPT = `Classify and extract facts from this message. Manage two fact stores:

durable — stable claims that matter in a year
  Categories: identity (who they are), health, relationship, life_event, business_role, preference (likes/dislikes), goal

current — time-bound state (stale within weeks)
  Categories: feeling, physical_state, working_on, going_through, schedule_context

Rules:
- If a claim already exists in Known facts, emit strengthen (not add)
- "strengthen" means the same fact is reaffirmed without new information
- "contradict" means new information conflicts with an existing fact
- Paraphrases count as duplicates — match meaning, not exact words
- Return {"ops":[]} for questions, small talk, or messages with no factual claims about the user

Ops schema — each op is a flat JSON object:
{"op":"add_durable","claim":"string","category":"string","keywords":["string"]}
{"op":"add_current","claim":"string","category":"string","keywords":["string"]}
{"op":"strengthen","factId":"string"}
{"op":"decay","factId":"string","reason":"string"}
{"op":"contradict","factId":"string","proposedText":"string","reason":"string"}

keywords: 3–8 lowercase retrieval terms per add op.

Output: {"ops":[...]}
JSON only. No prose, fences, markdown, or thinking.`;
