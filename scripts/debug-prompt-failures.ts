const SR = `Decide whether to respond to this message.

Respond (YES):
- The message directly addresses or mentions you
- The message asks a question or makes a request you can address
- The message is a general request for assistance or information with no specific addressee

Do not respond (NO):
- The message is addressed to someone else
- The message is purely gratitude, agreement, or acknowledgment with no request
- The message is only an emoji, punctuation, or ambient reaction
- The message is a social question not directed at you (e.g., "Anyone going to the party?")
- No response is expected or needed

Output exactly one token: either YES or NO, with no surrounding whitespace.`;

const AP = `Select the next action based on the conversation context.

Actions:
- REPLY: Send a text response (greetings, factual answers, questions, general chat)
- SEARCH: Look up information online (current events, product details, facts not in training)
- SCHEDULE: Create a calendar event — use when the user says "schedule", "book", "block", "meeting", "appointment", or "add to calendar"
- REMIND: Set a time-based alert — use when the user says "remind me", "reminder", or "alert me at [time]"
- NOTES: Save information for later — use when the user says "note", "jot down", "remember", or captures an idea
- NONE: No response needed

NONE applies when the message is: emoji-only, single punctuation, pure reaction ("lol", "ok", "👍", "..."), or acknowledgment with no follow-up request.
Default to REPLY when no other action clearly fits.

Return ONLY this JSON (no extra whitespace):
{"toolCalls":[{"name":"ACTION_NAME","args":{}}]}

No explanation. JSON only.`;

const FE = `Classify and extract facts from this message. Manage two fact stores:

durable — stable claims that matter in a year
  Categories: identity (who they are), health, relationship, life_event, business_role, preference (likes/dislikes), goal

current — time-bound state (stale within weeks)
  Categories: feeling, physical_state, working_on, going_through, schedule_context

Rules:
- If a claim already exists in Known facts, emit strengthen (not add)
- "strengthen" means the same fact is reaffirmed without new information
- "contradict" means new information conflicts with an existing fact
- Paraphrases count as duplicates — match meaning, not exact words
- Return {"ops":[]} for questions, small talk, or messages with no factual claims about the user

Ops schema — each op is a flat JSON object:
{"op":"add_durable","claim":"string","category":"string","keywords":["string"]}
{"op":"add_current","claim":"string","category":"string","keywords":["string"]}
{"op":"strengthen","factId":"string"}
{"op":"decay","factId":"string","reason":"string"}
{"op":"contradict","factId":"string","proposedText":"string","reason":"string"}

keywords: 3–8 lowercase retrieval terms per add op.

Output: {"ops":[...]}
JSON only. No prose, fences, markdown, or thinking.`;

const OE = `Extract durable observations about the user from recent conversation exchanges.

Categories to look for:
- Preferences (tools, languages, workflows, communication style)
- Facts (role, location, projects they work on, tech stack)
- Standing instructions (things they always/never want)
- Patterns (recurring topics, how they like to work)

Return a JSON array of short observation strings (max 150 chars each).
If nothing meaningful is found, return an empty array [].
Do NOT include observations about the conversation itself, only about the user.

JSON only. Return one JSON array. No prose, fences, thinking, or markdown.`;

const MQ = `Answer the query using only the provided context. If context is insufficient, say so explicitly.
Keep the answer under 120 words.

JSON only. Return one JSON object with an "answer" field. No prose, fences, thinking, or markdown.`;

const SFU = `Extract follow-up scheduling information from the user's request.

Identify who to follow up with, when, why, and at what priority.

Return a JSON object:
{"contactName":"string","scheduledAt":"ISO8601 datetime or null","reason":"string or null","priority":"high|medium|low","message":"string or null"}

scheduledAt rules:
- Resolve relative dates ("next Monday", "tomorrow at 3pm") to ISO 8601 UTC using any datetime context provided
- When only a day is given with no time, default to 09:00 UTC
- Use null when the time is genuinely vague ("sometime", "in a few weeks", "eventually")
- priority defaults to "medium" when not specified
- message and reason are null when not mentioned

JSON only. Return one JSON object. No prose, fences, thinking, or markdown.`;
