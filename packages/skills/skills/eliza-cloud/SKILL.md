# Eliza Cloud

Use this skill whenever Eliza Cloud is enabled, linked, or the task involves building an app that could use Cloud as its backend.

## Default Stance

Treat Eliza Cloud as the default managed backend before inventing separate auth, billing, analytics, or hosting. In this repo, Cloud already supports:

- app registration and API keys
- `appId`-based app auth flows
- cloud-hosted chat, media, agent, and billing APIs
- app analytics, user tracking, domains, and credits
- creator monetization, app charge requests, affiliate links, x402 payment
  requests, and payout redemptions
- Docker container deployments for server-side workloads
- on-demand cloud tunnel provisioning for agents through Headscale-backed
  Tailscale sessions

## Read These References First

- `references/cloud-backend-and-monetization.md` for apps, auth, billing, and earnings
- `references/apps-and-containers.md` for deployment, domains, and container workflow
- `references/payments-and-promotion.md` for app charges, x402 requests, local billing proxy aliases, payout redemptions, promotion assets, advertising, image/video/music/TTS generation, and parent-agent Cloud commands

## Skill Pairing

Use `build-monetized-app` alongside this skill for any new Cloud app that
should earn money. `build-monetized-app` owns the build, deploy, monetize, and
custom-domain offer flow; `eliza-cloud` owns the current Cloud backend surface,
existing-app management, app charge requests, x402 requests, affiliate earnings,
payout redemptions, media/promotion, and account-bound parent-agent commands.
Spawned code agents should load or request both skills for Cloud app builds.

## Default Build Flow

For new agent-built apps, defer to `build-monetized-app`: register a Cloud app,
build and push a container image, deploy that container, enable monetization,
patch the app URL/origins, and then offer a custom domain. Static hosting is
only for legacy/local apps or edits to an existing static app.

For existing app work:

1. create or reuse an Eliza Cloud app
2. capture the app's `appId` and API key
3. configure `app_url`, allowed origins, and redirect URIs
4. use Cloud APIs as the backend
5. enable monetization if the app should earn
6. deploy a container only if server-side code is required

For static-hosted apps, do not deploy a container unless the app truly needs its
own server. Register the public static URL as the Cloud app, store the returned
`appId` in non-secret local config, and use a same-origin proxy to call Cloud
APIs. The config's `cloudUrl` is the browser-facing Cloud frontend/OAuth base
that serves `/app-auth/authorize`; it must come from
`ELIZA_CLOUD_PUBLIC_URL`, then `ELIZA_CLOUD_URL`, then `ELIZA_CLOUD_BASE_URL`
only when that same origin serves the frontend too. Do not point `cloudUrl` at
an API-only local worker such as `:8787`, and do not silently mix a localhost
API base with production OAuth. In private local testing, `apiBase:
http://localhost:8787/api/v1` pairs with `cloudUrl:
http://127.0.0.1:3000`; if `ELIZA_CLOUD_PUBLIC_URL` is set, use that public
frontend/OAuth origin instead.

AI inference apps are monetized apps by default. They must use app auth plus the
app-specific chat endpoint:

- Browser starts sign-in at `/app-auth/authorize` with `app_id`, `redirect_uri`, and `state`.
- Browser stores only the returned user token, never an owner API key.
- Browser calls the app's same-origin proxy with `x-user-token`.
- Proxy forwards to `/api/v1/apps/{id}/chat` with `Authorization: Bearer <user_jwt>`. The app-scoped chat route does **not** read `x-affiliate-code` — for affiliate-attributed inference send `POST /api/v1/messages` with `x-app-id` + `x-affiliate-code` instead (see `build-monetized-app`).
- Monetization uses `PUT /api/v1/apps/{id}/monetization` with markup/share fields.

## Important Reality Check

Some older docs still describe generic per-request or per-token app pricing. In this repo's current implementation, the active app monetization controls are markup/share-based. Prefer the current schema, UI, and API behavior in this repo when prose docs conflict.

## Payment And Money Flow Rules

Pick the narrowest money surface:

- **App monetization** (`PUT /api/v1/apps/{id}/monetization`) sets ongoing inference markup and app-credit purchase share. The inference markup is added to the cost debited from the caller's ORG credit balance and earned via `recordCreatorEarnings`; the purchase-share applies to the (currently stranded) per-app pool. It is not a one-off invoice.
- **App charge requests** (`POST /api/v1/apps/{id}/charges`) ask a user to pay an exact USD amount through Stripe or OxaPay. The payer receives app credits; creator earnings flow through the app-credit earnings ledger.
- **x402 payment requests** (`POST /api/v1/x402/requests`) ask for direct crypto settlement. Use these when the payer already has crypto or the flow is wallet-native. Current settlement support includes Base, Ethereum, BSC, and Solana; defaults point at `https://x402.elizacloud.ai`.
- **App-credit checkout** (`POST /api/v1/app-credits/checkout`) buys into the per-app pre-purchased credit pool (`app_credit_balances`). Note: inference billing was migrated to the org balance, so these purchases are currently stranded (issue #8253) — prefer org-credit checkout for spendable balance. Use app charge requests when the agent needs a durable request, metadata, callbacks, and a reusable payment URL.
- **Org-credit checkout** (`POST /api/v1/credits/checkout`) tops up the user's organization. It is not creator pricing.
- **Cloud tunnel provisioning** (`POST /api/v1/apis/tunnels/tailscale/auth-key`) debits org credits once per successful tunnel auth-key mint. It is on-demand infrastructure usage, not SaaS/subscription billing.
- **Redemptions** (`POST /api/v1/redemptions`) request creator payout in elizaOS tokens on `base`, `bsc`/`bnb`, `ethereum`, or `solana`. Payouts are fixed to the USD quote at request time and then admin reviewed/processed.

For agent-initiated charges, always include callback channel metadata when a
conversation should get the payment result:

```json
{ "callback_channel": { "roomId": "room-id", "agentId": "agent-id" } }
```

On success or failure, the Cloud payment services can write back to that same
room so the agent can tell the user whether the payment went through.

When running inside the local `@elizaos/plugin-elizacloud` route plugin, use
`/api/cloud/billing/*` aliases instead of exposing Cloud credentials to browser
or app code. They proxy to the real Cloud API and preserve x402 payment headers:

- `/api/cloud/billing/x402/*` -> `/api/v1/x402/*`
- `/api/cloud/billing/apps/{appId}/charges/*` -> `/api/v1/apps/{appId}/charges/*`
- `/api/cloud/billing/apps/{appId}/earnings/*` -> `/api/v1/apps/{appId}/earnings/*`
- `/api/cloud/billing/apps/{appId}/monetization` -> `/api/v1/apps/{appId}/monetization`
- `/api/cloud/billing/app-credits/*` -> `/api/v1/app-credits/*`
- `/api/cloud/billing/affiliates/*` -> `/api/v1/affiliates/*`
- `/api/cloud/billing/redemptions/*` -> `/api/v1/redemptions/*`

Do not hand-calculate payment totals. The creator supplies the requested amount;
Cloud returns platform/service fees, total charged amount, headers, URLs, and
status fields. Show or store the returned values.

## Management surface — what users can ask for

This is the catch-all skill for any user request about apps they already own. Endpoints + intent map:

| User says | Endpoint | Method |
|---|---|---|
| `list my apps` | `/api/v1/apps` | GET |
| `show me my app X` / `app details` | `/api/v1/apps/{id}` | GET |
| `rename my app` / `change app config` | `/api/v1/apps/{id}` | PATCH |
| `delete this app` | `/api/v1/apps/{id}` | DELETE |
| `list my containers` | `/api/v1/containers` | GET |
| `change container tier / size` | `/api/v1/apps/{id}` (container fields) | PATCH |
| `what are my earnings` | `/api/v1/apps/{id}/earnings` | GET |
| `set markup percentage` | `/api/v1/apps/{id}/monetization` | PUT |
| `charge this user` / `send a payment request` | `/api/v1/apps/{id}/charges` or `/api/v1/x402/requests` | POST |
| `check if they paid` | `/api/v1/apps/{id}/charges/{chargeId}` or `/api/v1/x402/requests/{id}` | GET |
| `create checkout for that charge` | `/api/v1/apps/{id}/charges/{chargeId}/checkout` | POST |
| `create affiliate code` | `/api/v1/affiliates` | POST |
| `link affiliate code` | `/api/v1/affiliates/link` | POST |
| `show payout balance` | `/api/v1/redemptions/balance` | GET |
| `quote payout` | `/api/v1/redemptions/quote` | GET |
| `request payout` | `/api/v1/redemptions` | POST |
| `show app analytics / usage` | `/api/v1/apps/{id}/analytics` | GET |
| `regenerate my api key` | `/api/v1/apps/{id}/regenerate-api-key` | POST |
| `list app users` | `/api/v1/apps/{id}/users` | GET |
| `top up org credits` | `/api/v1/credits/checkout` or `/dashboard/billing` | POST / hosted |
| `top up app credits` | `/api/v1/app-credits/checkout` | POST |
| `start/provision a cloud tunnel` | `/api/v1/apis/tunnels/tailscale/auth-key` via `@elizaos/plugin-tailscale` | POST |
| `dashboard overview` | `/api/v1/dashboard` | GET |

Cloud tunnels are multi-tenant by construction: callers must authenticate as an
active Cloud user or API key with an organization, provisioning consumes org
credits immediately, keys are short-lived/non-reusable/ephemeral, the server
forces `tag:eliza-tunnel`, and the public proxy only forwards generated
signed `eliza-<org>-<random>-<expiry>-<signature>` hostnames into the Headscale
tailnet. Signed public hostnames expire with the tunnel provisioning window.

Always confirm before destructive actions (delete app, regenerate key) — show the user what's about to happen, ask for explicit yes.

For domain-specific ops:
- `eliza-cloud-buy-domain` — register a brand-new domain through cloudflare (paid from cloud credits)
- `eliza-cloud-manage-domain` — list / edit dns records / detach domains

For the build-and-monetize flow specifically:
- `build-monetized-app` — ships a new app, then proactively offers a custom domain at the end
