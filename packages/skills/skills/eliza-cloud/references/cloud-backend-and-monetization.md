# Eliza Cloud Backend And Monetization

## Why Use Cloud As The Backend

When Cloud is enabled, it already gives the app most of the backend primitives agents usually try to reinvent:

- authentication
- API keys
- usage tracking
- credits and billing
- analytics
- domains
- on-demand cloud tunnels
- app users
- creator earnings

For app work, the default assumption should be that Cloud is the backend unless there is a specific reason not to use it.

## App As The Integration Unit

The core unit is an app record.

Current app fields in this repo include:

- `id` / `appId`
- `name`
- `app_url`
- `allowed_origins`
- `website_url`
- `contact_email`
- deployment status and production URL
- monetization fields

Creating an app yields a unique API key and an app identifier. Use the app identifier for frontend/browser-facing flows and keep the API key on trusted server paths.

## User Auth Flow

The existing app auth flow expects:

- `app_id`
- `redirect_uri`
- optional `state`

The user signs into Eliza Cloud, the app is validated, and the user is redirected back with a token. This means users logging into the app can use Eliza Cloud as the backend identity and service layer instead of a separate auth stack.

## Billing And Credits

Cloud already exposes:

- credit balance APIs
- billing summary
- checkout / top-up flows
- payment methods
- billing history
- app charge requests that let agents ask a user to pay a specific dollar
  amount through Stripe or OxaPay and receive app credits after payment
- x402 payment requests for direct crypto settlement, with status checks and
  callbacks into the originating channel
- Headscale-backed cloud tunnel provisioning that debits org credits once per
  successful short-lived auth-key mint

In Eliza, billing is intended to stay inside the app where possible, with hosted URLs treated as fallback.

## Current App Monetization Model In This Repo

The app monetization implementation currently centers on:

- `monetization_enabled`
- `inference_markup_percentage`
- `purchase_share_percentage`
- `platform_offset_amount`
- `total_creator_earnings`

The UI describes this as:

- creators earn from inference markups
- creators earn a share when users buy app credits
- users pay app-specific credits

So when an agent builds an app on Cloud, it should understand that app usage can be monetized directly instead of treated as pure cost.

## Redeemable Earnings

Redeemable earnings in this repo explicitly include:

- app creator earnings
- agent creator earnings
- MCP creator earnings
- affiliate and revenue-share flows

That means apps, public agents, and MCP products can all participate in monetized Cloud flows.

Payout requests use `/api/v1/redemptions`. The creator chooses a payout network
(`base`, `bsc`/`bnb`, `ethereum`, or `solana`) and a payout address. The request
is fixed to a dollar value at request time; admin review and payout processing
send the equivalent elizaOS token amount for that fixed USD value.

## Affiliate And Marked-Up Usage

The Cloud UI also includes affiliate markup flows where a code can add markup to usage and credit top-ups. This is separate from per-app monetization, but it reinforces the same principle: Cloud is designed to let builders earn on top of platform usage rather than only consume credits.

Use `/api/v1/affiliates` to create/update the current user's affiliate code and
`/api/v1/affiliates/link` to attach a paying user to a referring code.

## Agent-Initiated Payments

For "please send me $5" style flows, prefer:

- `/api/v1/apps/{id}/charges` when the payer should buy app credits through
  Stripe or OxaPay.
- `/api/v1/x402/requests` when the payer already has crypto and can settle a
  direct x402 request.

Both request types carry callback URL/channel metadata. Include the initiating
room and agent id in the callback channel so success/failure events can be
written back to the same conversation.

## Cloud Tunnel Provisioning

Agents that need to expose a local port should use `@elizaos/plugin-tailscale`
in cloud mode instead of minting VPN credentials directly. The plugin calls
`POST /api/v1/apis/tunnels/tailscale/auth-key`, then runs `tailscale up` and
`tailscale serve` locally. The route requires a Cloud user/API key with an
active organization, charges org credits once using `TUNNEL_AUTH_KEY_COST_USD`,
refunds on Headscale mint failure, forces `tag:eliza-tunnel`, and returns a
generated `eliza-<org>-<random>-<expiry>-<signature>.tunnel.elizacloud.ai`
hostname. This is pay-as-needed infrastructure usage, not subscription SaaS. In
production the hostname includes an expiry and HMAC suffix, so the Railway
proxy only forwards unexpired hostnames minted by the Cloud Worker.
