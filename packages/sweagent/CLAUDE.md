# @elizaos/sweagent-root

Security-patched vendor sources for SWE-agent (GHSA-jvqc-qp6c-g58f, GHSA-w846-hghr-xmrc). Not a published elizaOS plugin.

## Purpose / role

This package holds security-remediated copies of upstream SWE-agent sources (Python inspector and TypeScript tools). The full SWE-agent build graph is **not vendored on the `develop` branch** — this directory exists for cherry-pick, npm release, or private-fork publication. No other package in the elizaOS monorepo imports from here at runtime.

## Layout

```

## Key exports / surface

This package is `private: true` and has no `exports` field. Nothing in the monorepo imports it at runtime. The security helpers in `security/` are internal to the package.

- `security/safe-path.ts` — `resolvePathWithinRoot(rootDir, userPath): string`. Throws `Error("Invalid path")` on traversal, absolute paths outside root, or null-byte injection.
- `security/safe-url.ts` — `assertHttpHttpsUrl(url): URL`. Throws on non-http/https protocols (blocks `file://`, SSRF via metadata endpoints, etc.).

The TypeScript inspector server (`typescript/src/inspector/server.ts`) exports `startInspectorServer(options)`. It calls `resolvePathWithinRoot` on every `GET /api/trajectory/:filename` request to prevent path traversal.

The web-browser tool (`typescript/tools/src/web-browser/index.ts`) calls `assertHttpHttpsUrl` before every `page.goto()` call and disables the `executeScript()` method (throws on any call).

## Commands

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/sweagent test   # vitest run (security unit tests only)
```

## Config / env vars

| Var | Where used | Effect |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| `WEB_BROWSER_HEADLESS` | `web-browser/index.ts` | Set to `"0"` to run Chromium with a visible window (default headless) |

Inspector `port` and `trajectoryDir` are passed as CLI flags, not env vars. TypeScript server: `--port=`, `--dir=`. Python server: `--port`, `--directory`. The `host` option in `startInspectorServer()` defaults to `127.0.0.1` and is not exposed as a CLI flag or env var in the current CLI entry point.

## Security advisories

See `SECURITY.md` for full CVE details. Two advisories are addressed:

- **GHSA-jvqc-qp6c-g58f** — Inspector `GET /api/trajectory/:filename` path traversal. Fixed with `resolvePathWithinRoot()` in both TS and Python servers. Default bind changed to `127.0.0.1`.
- **GHSA-w846-hghr-xmrc** — Path traversal, SSRF/local file read via `web-browser`, command injection in `str-replace-editor`. Fixed with `assertHttpHttpsUrl()`, disabled `executeScript`, and safe path handling.

**The inspector HTTP server is not shipped in the develop build** — its removal is the effective mitigation for this repo. npm alpha releases still need a patched version.

## Conventions / gotchas

- The `typescript/tools/src/edit-anthropic/str-replace-editor.ts` imports `../registry` which is not present in this tree — that module resolves only in the upstream SWE-agent tool bundle. Do not run it in isolation without the registry shim.
- `typescript/src/utils/log.ts` is a minimal vendor logger shim that prefixes `console.log/error`. It is not the elizaOS structured logger.
- The Python inspector server (`server.py`) and TypeScript inspector server (`server.ts`) are parallel ports of the same upstream SWE-agent inspector; they are not called by each other.
- Tests cover only `security/safe-path.ts` and `security/safe-url.ts`. The inspector and tool sources have no unit tests in this package.
- For architecture rules, naming conventions, and global logging standards, see the root `AGENTS.md`.
