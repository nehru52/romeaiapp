/**
 * voice-warmup — background "warm like embedding" for voice models.
 *
 * Unlike embedding (which has a runtime-free `ensureModel` facade), the voice
 * models (local Whisper STT / Kokoro TTS, or cloud ElevenLabs) only load
 * through the live agent runtime's `useModel(TRANSCRIPTION | TEXT_TO_SPEECH, …)`
 * path — the Kokoro bridge auto-starts on the first TEXT_TO_SPEECH call, and
 * the cloud handler validates its connection. So we warm them AFTER the runtime
 * is ready by firing one tiny request at each, fire-and-forget. That actually
 * loads (not just downloads) the models, so the first real voice interaction is
 * instant — the embedding warmup's spirit, via the path voice already uses.
 * Nothing in the voice engine is touched.
 *
 * BEHAVIOR CHANGE (PR #8175): warmup now fires for **both** local and cloud
 * setups. Previously, warmup was gated on `localInferenceActive` and was
 * suppressed for cloud-configured users. The gate has been removed.
 *
 * Impact for cloud users: at every desktop boot, two tiny API calls (one
 * silent WAV for STT, one empty-string TTS) will be dispatched through the
 * runtime's model router to whichever cloud voice provider is configured
 * (e.g. ElevenLabs, Eliza Cloud TTS). These calls are billable if the
 * provider charges per-request. They are intentionally small (~100 ms WAV for
 * STT, empty string for TTS) and non-blocking (fire-and-forget). Failures are
 * non-fatal and logged at WARN level.
 *
 * To suppress warmup entirely (both local and cloud) set:
 *   ELIZA_SKIP_LOCAL_VOICE_WARMUP=1
