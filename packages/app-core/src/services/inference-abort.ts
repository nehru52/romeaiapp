/**
 * Per-runtime in-flight inference AbortController registry.
 *
 * Wave 3C's `useAppLifecycleEvents` hook (`packages/ui/src/state/
 * useAppLifecycleEvents.ts`) fires `chatAbortRef.current?.abort()` on
 * `APP_PAUSE_EVENT` to cancel UI-side streams before iOS suspends the
 * WKWebView. That covers the UI's fetch streams. This module covers the
 * runtime side: inference paths internal to the agent (the AOSP llama FFI
 * adapter, the cloud-fallback wrapper, and local model calls) can register
 * their `AbortController` here so a single hook can
 * abort ALL of them at once on pause / shutdown / account switch.
 *
 * Contract:
 *  - `trackInflight(runtime, ctrl)` returns a disposer. Callers MUST call
 *    the disposer in their `finally` block so completed calls don't keep
 *    references alive.
 *  - `abortInflightInference(runtime)` calls `.abort()` on every tracked
 *    controller for the runtime and clears the set. Returns the count so
 *    the caller can log how many were canceled.
 *  - WeakMap-keyed by runtime so per-account or test-runtime instances
 *    don't leak across each other.
