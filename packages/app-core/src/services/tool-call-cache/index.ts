/**
 * Re-export of the tool-call cache surface.
 *
 * The implementation lives in @elizaos/agent under runtime/tool-call-cache
 * because the runtime wrapper is the primary integration point and the
 * agent package cannot depend on app-core (the dependency edge runs the
 * other way). This file exposes the cache from the canonical app-core
 * services path so external callers can locate it without reaching into
 * the agent package layout.
