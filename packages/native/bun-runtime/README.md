# @elizaos/bun-ios-runtime

This package owns the full Bun engine port for iOS. It intentionally lives under
`packages/` so the repo does not need a separate top-level native workspace.

The current upstream Bun release does not publish an iOS target for
`bun build --compile`; the supported standalone executable targets are Linux,
macOS, and Windows. A real phone build therefore needs an embeddable iOS
framework produced from a Bun fork, not a macOS Bun executable copied into an
iOS app bundle.

## Artifact contract

The app build looks for this framework when `ELIZA_IOS_FULL_BUN_ENGINE=1`:

```text
packages/native/bun-runtime/artifacts/ElizaBunEngine.xcframework
```

You can override the path with:

```bash
ELIZA_IOS_BUN_ENGINE_XCFRAMEWORK=/absolute/path/ElizaBunEngine.xcframework
```

The app build validates an override first, then stages it into
`packages/native/bun-runtime/artifacts/` before CocoaPods runs. The Podspec only
accepts vendored frameworks inside this package so full-Bun builds do not depend
on an external absolute path at install/sign time.

If full-engine mode is requested and the framework is missing, the iOS build
fails before CocoaPods instead of falling back to the JSContext compatibility
host.

## Reference ports

The harness follows the same practical shape as the public mobile runtime
examples:

- `dannote/pi-ios` and `dannote/bun` prove the iOS Bun path by building
  JavaScriptCore in `JSCOnly` / C_LOOP / no-JIT mode, then linking Bun as app
  code that exposes `bun_start(...)`.
- `iOSExpertise/nodejs-mobile` uses the same packaging pattern we need here:
  build static mobile runtime pieces first, then wrap them in an iOS framework
  that Xcode/CocoaPods can sign and embed.

The package supplies the Eliza ABI shim in
`Sources/ElizaBunEngineShim/`. A Bun fork can either export the Eliza ABI
directly or expose the `src/ios/bun_ios.h` style API used by `dannote/bun`; the
build script wraps that Bun API into `ElizaBunEngine.framework`.

The exported Eliza ABI is documented in `BRIDGE_CONTRACT.md`:

- `eliza_bun_engine_abi_version`
- `eliza_bun_engine_last_error`
- `eliza_bun_engine_set_host_callback`
- `eliza_bun_engine_start`
- `eliza_bun_engine_stop`
- `eliza_bun_engine_is_running`
- `eliza_bun_engine_call`
- `eliza_bun_engine_free`

Full-engine builds link this framework directly through CocoaPods and the Swift
module import, so production/App Store builds do not import dynamic-loader APIs.
Compatibility/debug builds keep an optional loader path so the JSContext bridge
can run without embedding the full engine framework. When the framework exists,
`start()` defaults to `engine: "auto"` and will boot the full engine. Passing
`engine: "bun"` requires the framework and returns an error if it is missing.

## SwiftBun compatibility lane

SwiftBun is tracked as an optional JavaScriptCore bridge candidate, not as a
replacement for the TypeScript runtime or the full Bun framework path. The
policy is documented in `SWIFT_BUN_COMPATIBILITY.md` and codified in
`packages/app-core/src/platform/ios-runtime-backends.ts`.

The approved production local iOS backend remains
`ElizaBunEngine.xcframework`. A SwiftBun-compatible lane may be enabled only as
an explicit compatibility spike until it implements the existing
`ElizaBunRuntime` contract, proves `http_request` and `sendMessage` routing,
and reports unsupported native capabilities truthfully.

Both lanes are native iOS app-process lanes. Neither lane turns Swift into the
agent runtime owner; the TypeScript agent bundle remains the runtime surface the
app talks to.

## App Store execution profile

Device/App Store builds of `ElizaBunEngine.xcframework` must be no-JIT and
must not depend on unsigned executable memory, downloaded native code, helper
executables, or arbitrary dynamic library loading. The framework metadata
declares this with:

```text
ElizaBunEngineNoJIT = true
ElizaBunEngineExecutionProfile = ios-app-store-nojit
```

The build and verifier reject engine binaries that import local code-loading or
JIT-sensitive symbols such as `dlopen`, `dlsym`, `posix_spawn`, `fork`,
`execve`, `system`, `pthread_jit_write_protect_np`, `mach_vm_protect`, or
`vm_protect`. Regular file-backed model/runtime assets remain allowed; they are
data inputs to the signed in-process runtime, not executable payloads.

```bash
# Verify the staged xcframework.
bun run --cwd packages/native/bun-runtime verify:app-store

# Verify only the device slice. This must fail until the xcframework contains
# ios-arm64 and the engine imports no dynamic-loader/process/JIT symbols.
bun run --cwd packages/native/bun-runtime verify:app-store -- --target=device

# Verify a signed .app bundle and its embedded ElizaBunEngine framework.
bun run --cwd packages/native/bun-runtime verify:app-store -- --app=/path/to/App.app
```

## Build workflow

```bash
# Verify upstream target reality on the current Bun binary.
bun run --cwd packages/native/bun-runtime check

# Build the simulator engine from a fork checkout.
ELIZA_BUN_IOS_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/elizaos-bun \
  bun run --cwd packages/native/bun-runtime build:sim

# Build and require the full engine inside the iOS app.
ELIZA_IOS_FULL_BUN_ENGINE=1 \
  bun run --cwd packages/app build:ios:local:sim
```

By default the build script expects a fork checkout at
`packages/native/bun-runtime/vendor/bun` or `ELIZA_BUN_IOS_SOURCE_DIR`. The public
`https://github.com/elizaos/bun` repository was not available at the time this
package was added, so the scripts do not silently clone or vendor upstream Bun.

The CMake backend is selected automatically when the source checkout has a
`CMakeLists.txt`. Useful inputs:

```bash
# Staged WebKit/JSC output with lib/ and JavaScriptCore/Headers/.
ELIZA_BUN_IOS_WEBKIT_BUILD_DIR=/path/to/WebKitBuild/JSCOnly

# Or a ready include/lib staging directory.
ELIZA_BUN_IOS_WEBKIT_PATH=/path/to/staged-ios-webkit

# Force CMake and pass fork-specific flags.
ELIZA_BUN_IOS_BUILD_BACKEND=cmake
ELIZA_BUN_IOS_CMAKE_ARGS="-DWEBKIT_PATH=/path/to/staged-ios-webkit"
```

The harness always passes the App Store runtime profile into the Bun fork:

```text
ELIZA_IOS_APP_STORE_LOCAL_EXECUTION=1
ELIZA_IOS_NO_JIT=1
ELIZA_IOS_DISABLE_DYNAMIC_LOADING=1
ELIZA_IOS_DISABLE_PROCESS_SPAWN=1
ELIZA_IOS_DISABLE_BUN_FFI=1
ELIZA_IOS_DISABLE_BUN_SHELL=1
ELIZA_IOS_DISABLE_BUN_SUBPROCESS=1
JSC_useJIT=0
BUN_JSC_useJIT=0
```

Fork builds should consume those as compile-time guards and compile out
`Bun.ffi`, native extension loading, `Bun.spawn`, `node:child_process`, shell
helpers, package install runners, and executable-memory/JIT permission paths for
the `ios-arm64` slice. The verifier groups failures by imported symbol family so
device builds fail on the source feature that remains, not just on a raw `nm`
line.

When the Bun fork emits `libbun-profile.a` or `CMakeFiles/bun-profile.dir/*.o`
plus `bun-zig.o`, this package links those objects with
`Sources/ElizaBunEngineShim/eliza_bun_engine_shim.c`, validates the required
symbols, and writes `artifacts/ElizaBunEngine.xcframework`.

## Runtime bridge

The C shim starts:

```text
public/agent/agent-bundle.js ios-bridge --stdio
```

`packages/agent/src/cli/ios-bridge.ts` then boots the real agent runtime and
handles foreground routes over the Capacitor-owned stdio IPC. UI calls flow:

```text
React fetch / Agent.request
  -> Capacitor ElizaBunRuntime.call("http_request")
  -> ElizaBunEngine C ABI
  -> stdio NDJSON
  -> agent ios-bridge
  -> in-process routes / buffered legacy handlers
```

Native llama calls use the same channel in the reverse direction. The agent
bundle emits `host_call` frames, the C shim invokes Swift, and Swift delegates
to `LlamaBridgeImpl`. No WebView, Bun, or native layer opens a TCP port for the
full-Bun local backend.

## Current status

Implemented in this repo:

- iOS app build gate for full-engine mode.
- CocoaPods podspec for a generated `ElizaBunEngine.xcframework`.
- C shim that wraps a `bun_start(...)` iOS fork into the Eliza ABI.
- ABI v3 host-call callback for native llama operations.
- Agent-side `ios-bridge --stdio` command for bridged HTTP requests and
  `send_message`.
- iOS full-Bun local-inference status and text-generation handlers over
  native IPC.
- React/UI transport that uses the full Bun bridge when the Capacitor plugin is
  present, otherwise falls back to the JSContext ITTP compatibility kernel.
- Runtime direct-link ABI that can boot a full Bun engine when the framework is
  present.
- Strict probes that prove current upstream Bun has no `bun-ios-*` compile
  target.

Still required in the Bun fork:

- Add or maintain iOS and iOS Simulator targets in Bun's Zig/WebKit/JSC build.
- Produce `ElizaBunEngine.xcframework`.
- Export `bun_start(...)` compatible with `src/ios/bun_ios.h`, or export the
  Eliza ABI directly.
- Keep Bun FFI/native-plugin loading disabled or compiled out for iOS App Store
  slices so the engine does not import arbitrary dynamic-loader symbols.
- Run simulator smoke against `public/agent/agent-bundle.js`, then repeat on a
  developer-signed sideload/device build.
