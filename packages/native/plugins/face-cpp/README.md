# face-cpp

Standalone C library + GGUF conversion scripts that port BlazeFace
(face detection) and a 128-d face embedding network (FaceNet-style
or ArcFace-mini) onto the elizaOS/llama.cpp fork's ggml dispatcher.
The native runtime replaces the ONNX-backed `face-detector-mediapipe.ts`
path and provides the face-embedding surface needed to retire the
`face-recognition.ts` face-api.js / TensorFlow.js stack after production
parity rollout.

Today the model entry points in `include/face/face.h` are implemented by
`src/face_model.c` with pure-C scalar BlazeFace and embedder forwards.
The model-independent helpers are real and tested:

- `face_blazeface_make_anchors` — 896-anchor table for the
  128x128 BlazeFace front model.
- `face_blazeface_decode` — decode raw model outputs to
  source-pixel detections.
- `face_align_5pt` — 5-point similarity warp + bilinear sampler
  producing a 112x112 RGB face crop.
- `face_embed_distance` / `face_embed_distance_l2` — cosine and L2
  distance over unit-norm 128-d embeddings.

The full port plan — upstream pins, GGUF conversion approach, fork
integration steps, replacement path for the TS bindings — lives in
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). Read that before changing anything in this
