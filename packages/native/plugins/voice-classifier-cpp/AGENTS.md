# voice-classifier-cpp — port plan

**ONNX deprecation status (updated 2026-06-03):** the native C library now has
real scalar forward paths for `voice_emotion_*`, `voice_speaker_*`, and
`voice_diarizer_*`. The audio-side `voice_eot_*` head validates GGUF metadata
but still returns `-ENOSYS` from `voice_eot_score` until an upstream audio-turn
model is pinned. The ONNX/runtime paths in the resolved production TypeScript
code remain active until the GGUF bindings are promoted and parity gates pass.

K7 audit confirmed:
- `voice-emotion-classifier.ts` → `onnxruntime-node` (active, blocked on K1)
- `speaker/encoder.ts` → `onnxruntime-node` (active, blocked on K2)
- `speaker/diarizer.ts` → `onnxruntime-node` (active, blocked on K3)

Do NOT remove `onnxruntime-node` from `plugin-local-inference/package.json` until
the production TS services have swapped to the native bindings and the EOT gap
is resolved. See `.swarm/impl/K7-no-onnx.md §D` for the per-head migration
protocol and `.swarm/impl/I1-single-runtime.md §F` for the broader context.

Standalone C library that ports native voice-side classifiers to
the elizaOS/llama.cpp fork's ggml dispatcher, replacing the ONNX
runtime path used today by:

- `plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/voice/voice-emotion-classifier.ts`
  (Wav2Small / wav2vec2-emotion via onnxruntime-node);
- `plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/voice/eot-classifier.ts`
  (the `LiveKitTurnDetector` / `TurnsenseEotClassifier` text-side EOT
  classifiers — this library's EOT head is the **audio**-side semantic
  end-of-turn detector that pairs with them);
- `plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/voice/speaker/encoder.ts`
  (WeSpeaker ResNet34-LM via onnxruntime-node).
- `plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/voice/speaker/diarizer.ts`
  (pyannote segmentation via onnxruntime-node).

Today this package has three implemented native heads plus one explicit
fail-closed boundary:

- emotion: Wav2Small scalar C forward path;
- speaker: WeSpeaker ResNet34-LM scalar C forward path;
- diarizer: pyannote-3 scalar C forward path;
- audio EOT: GGUF metadata validation only; `voice_eot_score` returns
  `-ENOSYS` until an upstream audio-turn model and graph are pinned.

## Why one library, four heads

All four classifiers have the same shape: small input window of mono
16 kHz float PCM → small fixed-shape output. They share a log-mel
front-end (n_mels=80, n_fft=512, hop=160), the same audio plumbing,
the same threading contract, the same error model, and the same
diagnostic surface (`voice_classifier_active_backend`). Bundling them
as one library means:

- one CMake target, one set of compiler flags, one shared mel
  precomputation table;
- the eventual ggml dispatcher integration patches the fork once, and
  the heads pick it up;
- the GGUF schema is per-head (one `.gguf` file per head) but the
  metadata-key conventions (`voice_emotion.variant`, etc.) follow the
  same pattern so the runtime can refuse mismatched bundles uniformly.

The heads keep separate session handles so a runtime can load
only what it needs (e.g. mobile bundles often skip the speaker head).

## Per-head port plan

### Emotion (`voice_emotion_*`)

- **Output contract.** 7-class soft probabilities over the basic
  emotion set, in this exact order:

  ```
  0 = neutral
  1 = happy
  2 = sad
  3 = angry
  4 = fear
  5 = disgust
  6 = surprise
  ```

  This order is the contract for the GGUF conversion script, the
  runtime decode, and the TS binding. `voice_emotion_class_name(idx)`
  is the canonical accessor; the table lives in
  `src/voice_emotion_classes.c` and `test/voice_emotion_classes_test.c`
  enforces the order.

- **Suggested upstreams.** `harshit345/xlsr-wav2vec-speech-emotion-recognition`
  (CC-BY-NC research; would need a license-clean replacement before
  shipping) or — better for licensing — distill a small student from
  `audeering/wav2vec2-large-robust-12-ft-emotion-msp-dim` plus a
  V-A-D → 7-class projection table. SpeechBrain
  (`speechbrain/emotion-recognition-wav2vec2-IEMOCAP`) is another
  Apache-2.0 option.

- **Model arch.** Whatever upstream we pick, the recommended target is
  a wav2vec2-style or HuBERT-style encoder + linear classification
  head, distilled small enough for CPU dispatch (~10-50 MB). The
  conversion script packs encoder weights + classifier head weights
  into one GGUF.

### End-of-turn (`voice_eot_*`)

- **Output contract.** A single P(end_of_turn) ∈ [0, 1].

- **Suggested upstreams.** `livekit/turn-detector` audio variants (if /
  when published) or `pipecat-ai/turn`. The text-side EOT classifiers
  in `plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/voice/eot-classifier.ts`
  (`LiveKitTurnDetector`, `TurnsenseEotClassifier`) operate on partial
  transcripts; this library's EOT head operates on **audio** and
  complements them — the runtime can fuse the two signals.

- **Model arch.** A small audio encoder (likely whisper-derived or a
  custom small RNN/Transformer trained on turn-completion labels) with
  a sigmoid head. The conversion script packs encoder + head as one
  GGUF.

### Speaker embedding (`voice_speaker_*`)

- **Output contract.** A 192-dim L2-normalized speaker embedding.
  Cosine distance via `voice_speaker_distance` (real implementation in
  `src/voice_speaker_distance.c`) — identical=0, orthogonal=1,
  anti-parallel=2.

- **Suggested upstream.** `speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb` —
  Apache-2.0, ECAPA-TDNN, 192-dim embedding — matches the output dim
  this header is pinned around. The legacy WeSpeaker ResNet34-LM
  encoder used today produces 256-dim embeddings; converting that to
  192-dim would require a re-projection layer or re-training, so the
  ECAPA upstream is the cleaner replacement target.

- **Model arch.** ECAPA-TDNN: TDNN backbone + attentive statistical
  pooling + linear projection to 192 dim. The conversion script packs
  backbone + projection.

## Shared front-end

- **`voice_mel_compute`.** Real implementation in
  `src/voice_mel_features.c`. Slaney mel scale, periodic Hann window,
  naive O(N²) DFT (acceptable for the small windows the three heads
  consume; a future pass can swap in pocketfft / kissfft behind the
  same signature). Used by `test/voice_mel_features_test.c` (1 kHz
  sine → peak in low-mid mel band).

- **No allocations on the hot path.** Per-frame scratch is stack-local;
  the mel filterbank + Hann window are precomputed once into static
  arrays via a lazy-init guarded by a flag.

## C ABI (frozen by `include/voice_classifier/voice_classifier.h`)

Every model entry point keeps the frozen ABI byte-for-byte. The shared
utilities are real and stay as-is:

- `voice_emotion_class_name` — never NULL for valid indices, NULL for
  out-of-range; class order locked.
- `voice_speaker_distance` — cosine distance, real implementation,
  callable without an open session.
- `voice_mel_compute` / `voice_mel_frame_count` — real shared
  front-end.

Coordinate convention: every embedding / probability vector is in the
order documented in the header. Threading: reentrant against distinct
handles. Error codes: `errno`-style negatives. No silent fallbacks.

## GGUF conversion (one file per head)

Each head has its own conversion script under `scripts/`:

- `scripts/voice_emotion_to_gguf.py`
- `scripts/voice_eot_to_gguf.py`
- `scripts/voice_speaker_to_gguf.py`
- `scripts/voice_diarizer_to_gguf.py`

The converters follow the same metadata discipline (mirror of
`packages/native/plugins/doctr-cpp/scripts/doctr_to_gguf.py` and
`packages/native/plugins/polarquant-cpu/scripts/polarquant_to_gguf.py`):

- one writer per script, written-once metadata block, all tensors
  packed in a single pass;
- locked block-format constants at the top of the file (sample rate,
  mel parameters, output dim);
- pinned upstream commit recorded both in code and in the GGUF
  metadata key — runtime refuses unknown commits;
- explicit converter validation and hard errors on unknown checkpoints so a
  mismatched upstream cannot pass for working;
- per-head metadata key: `voice_emotion.variant`, `voice_eot.variant`,
  `voice_speaker.variant`, `voice_diarizer.variant` — the runtime checks each.

## elizaOS/llama.cpp fork integration

The runtime calls live in this library; the fork only needs to expose
its ggml dispatcher and any custom op the heads need (none expected
for the first pass — wav2vec2 / ECAPA-TDNN building blocks are already
covered by `ggml_conv_1d`, `ggml_norm`, `ggml_mul_mat`).

1. Bring up the speaker head first — pure feed-forward TDNN, smallest
   surface, easiest parity test (compare 192-dim cosine distance
   against the SpeechBrain reference for a small enrollment set).
2. Bring up the emotion head next — Wav2Small is implemented in scalar C;
   ggml promotion still needs the production binding/parity swap.
3. Bring up the EOT head last — depends on which upstream we land on;
   the turn-detection-from-audio research field is younger.
4. Add a `fork-integration/` directory if any new ggml ops or quant
   types are required (not expected). Mirror the layout used in
   `packages/native/plugins/polarquant-cpu/fork-integration/`.

## Replacement of the ONNX TS services

Once each `*_open` returns 0 and the parity tests in this directory
pass, the corresponding TS service swaps to the new ggml binding:

- `voice-emotion-classifier-ggml.ts` replaces `voice-emotion-classifier.ts`;
- `eot-classifier-ggml.ts` provides the audio-side EOT detector that
  pairs with the existing text-side classifiers in `eot-classifier.ts`;
- `speaker/encoder-ggml.ts` replaces `speaker/encoder.ts`.
- `speaker/diarizer-ggml.ts` replaces `speaker/diarizer.ts`.

The new TS files exist as **EXPERIMENTAL** bindings today (Phase 1).
Phase 2 wires them into the production pipeline once the ggml ports
land and parity gates pass.

## Build (today)

```
cmake -B packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp/build \
      -S packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp
cmake --build packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp/build -j
ctest --test-dir packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp/build --output-on-failure
```

Output: `libvoice_classifier.a`, the shared library, and ctest binaries:

- `voice_classifier_abi_smoke` — ABI failure paths clear out-parameters
  and keep unavailable forwards fail-closed.
- `voice_emotion_classes_test` — the 7-class vocabulary order is
  intact; out-of-bounds returns NULL.
- `voice_speaker_distance_test` — identical=0, orthogonal=1,
  anti-parallel=2; zero-norm and NULL inputs degrade to 1.
- `voice_mel_features_test` — a 1 kHz sine produces a stable mel-band
  peak in the low-mid range and argument validation reports the
  documented error codes.
- `voice_gguf_loader_test` — hand-rolled GGUF metadata fixtures are
  accepted/rejected correctly.
- `voice_diarizer_parity_test` — pyannote parity when GGUF fixtures are
  available; skipped without fixtures.
- `voice_speaker_parity_test` — WeSpeaker parity when GGUF fixtures are
  available; skipped without fixtures.

The unit tests pass on the dev host today; parity tests skip when their
large GGUF/reference fixture bundles are absent.

## What's missing before the port is real

- Pinned upstream commit + recorded weight download recipe for the
  audio-side EOT head.
- Audio-side EOT scoring graph selection and parity fixtures after an upstream
  audio-turn model is pinned. `scripts/voice_eot_to_gguf.py` already discovers
  encoder/head tensors and writes the locked GGUF metadata/payload; the runtime
  keeps scoring fail-closed until the graph contract is selected.
- Production TS binding promotion after parity gates pass.
- Per-head parity fixture bundles staged for local/CI runs where they are
  currently optional.
- `fork-integration/` patches if any new ggml ops or quant types are
  needed (none expected for the first pass).
