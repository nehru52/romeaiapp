"""Qwen3.5/Qwen3.6 model registry for the eliza training pipeline.

Single source of truth for which Qwen variant trains where, with what
optimizer + quantization combination, and what its memory budget looks like.

The eliza-1 line trains against Qwen3.5 for 0.8B/2B/4B/9B and Qwen3.6 for
the active 27B-class releases.
The legacy Qwen3 base models (``Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`` / ``Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B`` /
``Qwen/Qwen3-4B``) were dropped on 2026-05-12 per operator directive — the
Qwen3 dense bases do not work with the eliza-1 mtp spec-decode path
(the mtp kernels are validated against the Qwen3.5 architecture +
248320 tokenizer; a Qwen3 base has the wrong vocab and the wrong attention
shape for the fused QJL/Polar paths). Historical per-tier repos remain public
for existing downloads, but their model cards are marked DEPRECATED and no new
SFT runs target them. New raw and fine-tuned bundles publish into the single
``elizaos/eliza-1`` repo under ``bundles/<tier>/``.

The active entries map onto the size-first ``eliza-1-*`` tier ids used
by the runtime model catalog (``packages/shared/src/local-inference/catalog.ts``
— ``ELIZA_1_TIER_IDS`` / ``MODEL_CATALOG``):

  - ``qwen3.5-0.8b`` → ``Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B-Base`` → ``eliza-1-0_8b``  (local tier; new "smallest" tier; full-param SFT on one consumer GPU; trains from the Base pretrain checkpoint, not the instruct release)
  - ``qwen3.5-2b``   → ``Qwen/Qwen3.5-2B-Base``   → ``eliza-1-2b``    (mid local tier; full-param SFT on a 16-24 GB GPU)
  - ``qwen3.5-4b``   → ``Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B-Base``   → ``eliza-1-4b``    (local/workstation tier; full-param SFT on a 24-28 GB GPU)
  - ``qwen3.5-9b``   → ``Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B``        → ``eliza-1-9b``    (workstation tier; 80 GB-class GPU)
  - ``qwen3.6-27b``  → ``Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B``       → ``eliza-1-27b``   (cloud tier; dense 27B; gpu-h200x2)

All active bases are published on the Hub. The 9b/27b tiers need workstation /
cloud-class GPUs (or FSDP). Every Qwen3.5/Qwen3.6 target's MTP
speculative-decode drafter uses the Qwen3.5 tokenizer (vocab 248320). The
small 0_8b/2b drafters are compact 0.1B/0.3B configs distilled from their
targets; larger tiers use ``Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B-Base``. See
``MTP_DRAFTER_BASE`` below and ``scripts/distill_mtp_drafter.py``.

The numbers below are observed-or-projected memory budgets for full-parameter
SFT with APOLLO at the listed sequence length. They are *budgets* — the
actual training script logs real memory through ``instrumentation.py`` and
will fail loud if reality exceeds the budget by more than 10%.
