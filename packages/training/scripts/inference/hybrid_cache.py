"""Hybrid linear-attention + full-attention KV cache for active Qwen3.5 models.

Background
----------

Qwen3.5 (``Qwen3_5ForCausalLM`` / ``Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration``,
likewise the ``-MoE`` text variants) interleaves two attention types on a 4-layer
period:

    layer 0..2   : Gated DeltaNet (``linear_attention``)
    layer 3      : standard self-attention (``full_attention``)
    layer 4..6   : Gated DeltaNet
    layer 7      : standard self-attention
    ...

Each layer type needs a different cache. Linear-attention layers carry an SSM-
style recurrent state plus a small conv state (no per-token KV). Full-attention
layers carry a standard ``(B, H, T, D)`` KV cache.

HuggingFace's ``Cache`` already supports this if you build it correctly: pass
``DynamicCache(config=model.config)`` and it pre-builds the right per-layer
mixin. The crash this module fixes is what happens when we wrap that cache
with a quantizer that does NOT pre-populate the layer list, e.g.
``fused_turboquant.hf.fused_cache.CompressedKVCache(DynamicCache)`` calls
``super().__init__()`` with no config, so the cache holds zero layers, and the
first time the Qwen3.5 model calls ``has_previous_state(layer_idx=0)`` (which
is a Gated DeltaNet layer), the parent ``Cache.has_previous_state`` walks the
empty layer list, finds no ``LinearAttentionCacheLayerMixin`` and either
returns False (lucky) or raises::

    ValueError: `has_previous_state` can only be called on LinearAttention
    layers, and the current Cache seem to only contain Attention layers.

``ElizaHybridCache`` solves this by being layer-type-aware from the start.
For each entry of ``model.config.get_text_config(decoder=True).layer_types``
we install:

    * ``"linear_attention"``  -> ``LinearAttentionLayer`` (SSM/conv state)
    * ``"full_attention"``    -> a backend-chosen layer:

        - ``bf16``               (``DynamicLayer``, default fallback)
        - ``fused_turboquant``   (delegates to ``CompressedKVCache``)
        - ``qjl_full``           (QJL on K + TurboQuant on V; needs the QJL
                                  CUDA extension to be built — falls back
                                  loudly if the kernel isn't available)

In the ``fused_turboquant`` and ``qjl_full`` modes we do NOT just hand the
model a CompressedKVCache: those classes hold a flat list of compressed K/V
slots indexed by ``layer_idx`` directly, so a Gated DeltaNet layer at
``layer_idx=0`` would write conv state into slot 0 of the compressed list
and then a full-attention layer at ``layer_idx=3`` would write a key tensor
into slot 3, with all the linear-attention slots in between left as
``None`` sentinels. That's broken in two ways: (1) the model still tries
to call ``update_conv_state(...)`` / ``update_recurrent_state(...)`` on
slot 0 and the quantizer's parent has no such methods, (2) the patched
fused-attention forward expects to read its own slot back as a packed-key
dict, not a conv state.

So the wiring is: ``ElizaHybridCache`` is the single object the model sees
as ``past_key_values``. Its ``self.layers`` is a heterogeneous list (per
``layer_types``). For ``fused_turboquant`` / ``qjl_full``, the cache also
holds a side ``CompressedKVCache`` that the patched fused-attention forward
closures reference by closure, and the corresponding entries of
``self.layers`` are ``DynamicLayer`` sequence trackers that keep sequence
length so HF's cache bookkeeping (``get_seq_length`` etc.) stays correct.

The model's own forward path calls ``self.layers[layer_idx].update(...)``
through ``Cache.update``. For full-attention layers under fused_turboquant
the caller is the patched fused forward, which calls
``cache.update(dummy_keys, dummy_values, layer_idx)`` where ``cache`` is
the side ``CompressedKVCache`` — but ``ElizaHybridCache`` IS that side
cache (we use composition by inheriting the ``store_compressed_*``,
``get_compressed_*``, ``decode_values`` methods directly). The
``DynamicLayer`` sequence tracker in ``self.layers[layer_idx]`` collects the
single-coord ``dummy_keys`` so that ``get_seq_length`` returns the right
number.

Multimodal models (``Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration``) wrap the text
decoder under ``model.language_model``. We don't load those here — the
factory raises with a clear pointer to ``AutoModelForImageTextToText``
when given one.
