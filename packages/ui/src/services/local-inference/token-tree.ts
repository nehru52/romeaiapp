/**
 * Token-tree (prefix-trie) for deterministic-region decode.
 *
 * Background
 * ----------
 * The local llama-server engine constrains structured output (Stage-1
 * HANDLE_RESPONSE envelope, Stage-2 PLAN_ACTIONS args) with a GBNF grammar
 * produced by `@elizaos/core` `buildResponseGrammar` /
 * `buildPlannerActionGrammarStrict`. Grammar enforcement is a *rejection*
 * filter — the model samples a token, the sampler rejects invalid ones, and
 * if the top-K sample is rejected the engine re-rolls. That's wasted forward
 * passes inside positions where the *set of legal continuations is already
 * pinned by the grammar* (an enum value, an action name from the exposed
 * tools, a numeric field with a known range).
 *
 * This module produces the data the fork-side sampler needs to skip the
 * re-roll entirely: a tokenized prefix-trie of the exposed action names (or
 * the values of an enum field). At each generation step inside the
 * constrained span the sampler walks one step in the trie, restricts the
 * logit pool to ONLY the valid next tokens, and takes argmax. Never produces
 * an invalid token, never re-rolls.
 *
 * Relationship to existing pieces
 * --------------------------------
 *   - `@elizaos/core` `buildPlannerActionGrammarStrict(...)` — already emits
 *     the GBNF that pins the `action` value to a fixed enum and constrains
 *     each branch's `parameters`. The trie here is the per-token
 *     materialisation of that same enum, ready for the fork's
 *     argmax-among-valid-tokens path (P2-6 in
 *     `packages/training/benchmarks/INFERENCE_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md`).
 *   - `ResponseSkeleton.spans` (in `packages/core/src/types/model.ts`) —
 *     each `enum` span's `enumValues` is the input set this module
 *     tokenizes. Single-value enums are already collapsed to `literal` spans
 *     by the producer, so the trie only matters for multi-value enums.
 *
 * What this module is NOT
 * -----------------------
 *   - It does NOT itself constrain decode — that requires the fork-side
 *     sampler to consume the trie. The wire format here is an offline
 *     description; server-side wiring is tracked under P2-6.
 *   - It does NOT replace the GBNF grammar. The grammar still defines the
 *     JSON envelope and the cross-span structure; the trie applies inside
 *     individual `enum` spans (or the action-name value of the planner
 *     envelope).

/**
 * A single node in a token-prefix trie.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *   - `tokenId` is the token id of the edge that *enters* this node. The
 *     synthetic root has no entering token; we model that with `tokenId =
 *     -1` and treat it as a sentinel.
 *   - `children` is keyed by the next-token id; lookups are O(1).
 *   - `isTerminal` is true when the path from root to this node spells a
 *     complete leaf value. A node may be both terminal AND have children —
 *     that's the case when one leaf is a strict prefix of another (e.g.
 *     `OWN` is a prefix of `OWNER_REMINDERS` if the tokenizer splits them
 *     into prefix-sharing token sequences). The sampler stops if `isTerminal
 *     && children.size === 0`; otherwise it may continue greedily provided
 *     the next-token argmax is still in `children`.
 *   - `leafName` carries the original leaf value the path encodes — used
 *     for debugging / telemetry only. Set on every terminal node.
