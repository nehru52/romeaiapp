/**
 * Shell component subset — curated re-exports consumed by App.tsx.
 *
 * When adding a new shell/page component, add it here AND in
 * `./components/index.ts`. Both files must stay in sync.
 *
 * In addition to the static re-exports below, this module re-exports a tiny
 * runtime registry (`registerAppShellPage` / `listAppShellPages`) that lets
 * plugins contribute pages dynamically without app-core hard-coding them.
 * The shell merges these registrations with each loaded plugin's
 * `app.navTabs` declaration and the static page list at render time.
