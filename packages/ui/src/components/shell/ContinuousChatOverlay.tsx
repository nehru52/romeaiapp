/**
 * The continuous-chat overlay: one always-present, ambient glass conversation
 * that floats over EVERY view. There are no separate chats and no switcher — it
 * is a single endless thread (the app's one active conversation, via
 * useShellController).
 *
 * Layout is a fixed composer at the bottom with a pull-up history SHEET above
 * it. At rest the sheet is a slim peek (the grabber + the latest line); pull it
 * UP — anywhere on the sheet — or just start typing to spring it open into the
 * full transcript; pull the grabber back DOWN, or press Escape, to close.
 * Nothing else dismisses it — clicking or scrolling the view behind does
 * nothing. The composer never moves; the history slides up over it.
 *
 * The container is pointer-events-none (the view behind stays live); only the
 * composer + sheet capture input, so it is non-blocking — unlike the
 * focus-trapping AssistantOverlay it supersedes in the main shell.
 *
 * Two design rules keep it intimate rather than app-like:
 *  1. SELF-CONTAINED CONTRAST — every surface carries its own dark-glass scrim
 *     (or, for floating text, a soft shadow) plus fixed light text, never the
 *     theme's `--txt`, so it stays legible over any substrate: a bright view, a
 *     dark view, or the warm "good evening" backdrop.
 *  2. NO CHROME/SIGNAGE — the thread speaks for itself: no message counter, no
 *     "new chat", no tab strip; controls dissolve into the glass, and status is
 *     a soft breath of light, not a brand-colored alert ring.
 *
 * Pure/presentational: it takes the controller as a prop so it can be rendered
 * in isolation (stories / harness) with a mock. The app wraps it in a small
 * context-reading mount (see App.tsx) that supplies the shared controller.
