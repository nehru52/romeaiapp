# PLAN.md — elizaOS Live build order

The phased work order to take elizaOS Live from "empty scaffold" to
"boots into a working elizaOS live desktop on real USB hardware, with
the AI app ready, optional Tor privacy mode, and optional encrypted
persistent storage."

This is a multi-week project. Each phase has a clear success criterion;
don't jump phases. With the containerized build (see Phase 1) a full ISO
is ~1–1.5 h cold, and incremental rebuilds (`just binary`) are ~10 min —
several phases still need iteration.

**Detailed, file-level implementation specs for each phase live in
[`docs/specs/`](./docs/specs/).** This PLAN is the map; the specs are the
turn-by-turn directions.

## Current status (2026-05-22)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Phase 0 — Scaffold** | ✅ Done |
| **Phase 1 — Base ISO builds + boots** | ✅ Done — base image builds and boots through QEMU via `-cdrom` |
| **Phase 2 — elizaOS system branding** | ✅ Source implemented; latest validated artifact QEMU visual path passed |
| **Phase 3 — Privacy mode** | 🔨 Source implemented; needs exact-release network/Tor validation |
| **Phase 4 — Bake elizaOS app** | ✅ App payload/install path QEMU-passed on latest validated artifact; clean checkout still must run `just elizaos-app` before a full build |
| **Phase 5 — Autolaunch** | ✅ Desktop/systemd wrapper QEMU-passed on latest validated artifact |
| **Phase 6 — Agent/broker** | 🔨 OS broker/env path implemented; approval-gated privileged actions still need hardening |
| **Phase 7 — Persistence** | ✅ Virtual USB-image create/unlock path QEMU-passed; physical USB reboot persistence validation still pending |
| **Phases 8–9** | 📋 Spec/backlog ([`docs/specs/`](./docs/specs/)), not release-complete |
| **Phases 10–11** | ⏳ Not started |

What exists right now:
- A **containerized build pipeline** (`Dockerfile`, `build.sh`, `build-iso.sh`,
  `acng.conf`, `Justfile`) that builds the ISO on any host with Docker — no
  Vagrant, no libvirt, no host-specific setup. See
  [`docs/build-infrastructure.md`](./docs/build-infrastructure.md).
- **6 genuine Tails Trixie-compat fixes** found while getting the build to
  run (5 builder-box fixes + 1 package-list fix — `gdisk`/`mtools` for the
  partitioning initramfs hook). All upstream-worthy.
- **Complete file-level specs** for every implementation phase (2–9) plus a
  product hardening plan for distribution, updates, production readiness,
  and the demo debt that still blocks a real release.
- **elizaOS OS-branding overlays** for boot menus, Plymouth, greeter,
  light blue/white GNOME defaults, wallpaper, identity strings, and Tails
  attribution.
- The **elizaOS desktop app** builds and is staged into the Tails
  overlay. The ISO install hook copies it to `/opt/elizaos`, fixes
  permissions, and removes the staging copy. `/opt/elizaos` is an internal
  runtime path until the app package itself is renamed.
- A narrow **elizaOS capability broker** exists at
  `/usr/local/lib/elizaos/capability-runner`. For the first rebuild it is
  intentionally conservative: status/privacy/persistence helpers plus exact
  sudo only for `root-status`; package/network mutation is deferred until an
  approval-gated policy layer exists.
- Privacy-mode, autolaunch, and `~/.eliza` Persistent Storage overlays are
  implemented locally. QEMU has proven the normal greeter/desktop/app path
  and virtual USB-image Persistent Storage creation on the latest validated
  local artifact. USB flash/readback passed on a prior artifact. The current
  gate is physical USB flash/readback for the exact current image, real USB
  boot, reboot persistence, and privacy behavior.
- The old root-level usbeliza Linux prototype was removed from this branch;
  this directory is the active Linux distro path.

See [`RELEASE_PATH.md`](./RELEASE_PATH.md) for the honest road from here to a real,
fully-working demo.

## v1.0 scope (locked 2026-05-14)

**USB-only** distribution with two storage modes and a privacy toggle.
**No install-to-internal-disk yet** — see § Deferred for the rationale.

### Storage modes (pick at boot)

1. **Amnesia (default)** — RAM only, no disk writes, full wipe on
   shutdown. Required for "borrowed laptop / hotel / zero footprint".
   Tails' default behavior, kept identical.
2. **Persistent USB (opt-in)** — LUKS-encrypted partition on the USB
   stick. Reuses Tails' native **Persistent Storage** (`tps`) tool
   unchanged. Selected dirs bind-mount from the LUKS partition.

### Privacy mode (independent of storage mode)

- **Normal (default)** — Tor routing OFF, direct internet, fast.
- **Privacy Mode (opt-in)** — Tor routing ON, using the preserved
  upstream Tor plumbing.

Both axes combine freely: 4 valid configurations.

|  | Amnesia | Persistent |
|---|---|---|
| **Normal** | "Burner laptop with AI" | "Portable AI computer" |
| **Privacy** | "Burner with full anonymity" | "Encrypted portable + anonymity" |

### Mode parity contract

The product target is that the same features work in all four
configurations. The only intended differences are:
- Speed (Tor is slower than direct internet)
- Trace footprint (amnesia writes no user state, persistent leaves encrypted
  data on USB)

See `docs/mode-parity.md` for the exhaustive feature matrix. Anything that
doesn't work in one mode gets a documented known-gap entry; no silent
feature loss. Phase 8 builds the harness that proves this. Until the
rebuilt ISO passes QEMU and real-USB validation, the matrix is an
acceptance target, not production evidence.

Known **v1.0 privacy gap**: embedded browser/OAuth surfaces are not
production-claimable in Privacy Mode until explicit proxy behavior is
proven. The live OS routing exists, but the app/browser layer still needs
validation and possibly runtime proxy injection. Documented in
`docs/privacy-mode-v1-gap.md`. Closing this is v1.1 work.

---

## Locked design decisions

### Architecture: full-fork of Tails, additive modifications

- Tails source lives in `tails/` at this directory's root (~6000
  tracked files, copied from a Tails `stable` clone).
- We **never delete** Tails code. All elizaOS additions are overlays,
  hooks, package-list additions, and replacement files inside Tails'
  tree. Tor, AppArmor, MAC spoofing, Persistent Storage, Plymouth — all
  stay intact.
- Primary user-facing strings should say elizaOS Live. Tails is credited
  in legal/about surfaces, while upstream names remain in engineering
  paths where they are required by the live-OS plumbing.
- Matches `packages/os/android/vendor/eliza/` precedent in this
  monorepo (brand vendor tree inside system structure).

### Build system: containerized (Phase 1 — done)

Tails' upstream build drives a Vagrant + libvirt VM. We **replaced that
with a plain container** — the container *is* the build environment.
Any dev on Linux/macOS/Windows/CI runs `just build` and gets the same
ISO. The earlier Vagrant attempt is documented (and buried) in
[`docs/build-infrastructure.md`](./docs/build-infrastructure.md); don't
resurrect it.

### Distribution architecture: ISO fallback plus verified updates

The production release shape is not "rebuild the ISO for every app
change." The intended architecture is:

- bake a known-good elizaOS app/runtime into the read-only ISO as the
  factory fallback
- store app/runtime updates in encrypted Persistent Storage
- select a persistent runtime only after boot-time signature and hash
  verification against a signed manifest
- fall back to the ISO runtime if persistence is absent, corrupted,
  revoked, incompatible, or fails verification
- deliver local models through a signed model catalog and signed/hash-pinned
  downloads, not by silently baking large/private models into every ISO
- update the base OS through signed full ISOs first, then signed
  Tails-style incremental kits or binary deltas where safe
- support enterprise channels with policy pins, internal mirrors,
  revocation, staged rollout rings, and non-secret fleet evidence

The checked verifier foundation now exists for signed app/runtime manifests,
root-owned materialization, and baked-runtime fallback. Production keys,
downloader UX, revocation, mirrors, rollback health promotion, model
downloads, and provenance gates are still release work. Until those exist,
builds are demos or test artifacts even if they boot.

### First-boot UX: elizaOS-branded greeter + elizaOS app

Tails uses a GTK greeter (`tails-greeter`) at first boot. We **keep
this UX** — it's battle-tested for live-USB scenarios — and rebrand it.

Boot sequence:
1. **boot menu** — pick "elizaOS" or "elizaOS — Privacy Mode"
2. **Plymouth splash** (elizaOS wordmark)
3. **elizaOS greeter** (rebranded `tails-greeter`):
   - Language / keyboard / formats
   - Admin password (sudo)
   - MAC spoofing on/off
   - **Persistent Storage**: "Unlock" (if exists) / "Create" (first time)
4. **GNOME loads** (Tails default DE, kept)
5. **The elizaOS app auto-launches as the always-on home window** —
   chat-driven onboarding for personal choices (name, what to build
   first, provider sign-in). It is not a kiosk: the normal GNOME desktop
   stays usable, and the app is supervised by a root-owned systemd service
   so closing/crashing it relaunches it.

System-level choices go through the GTK greeter. Personal/AI choices
go through the elizaOS app.

### Branding

- Full elizaOS brand in OS UI: boot splash, greeter title + colors, GNOME
  theme, wallpaper. Tails onion logo replaced with elizaOS artwork.
- No visible derivative branding in the primary boot/greeter/desktop
  path. Attribution is visible in credits/about/license surfaces.
- **Tails attribution** in:
  - `/usr/share/doc/elizaos-tails/CREDITS`
  - About elizaOS page (system)
  - License/credits docs shipped with the image
- License posture: **GPL-3.0-or-later** (inherited from Tails). Our
  Apache-2 contributions dual-licensed where possible.

### GPU access works in BOTH modes

Kernel loads GPU drivers (amdgpu, i915, nvidia, nouveau) regardless of
where root filesystem lives. Vulkan / CUDA / ROCm all functional from
USB boot. Local LLM gets full GPU acceleration on user's hardware.

### Feature parity matrix (high level — full version in docs/mode-parity.md)

| Feature | Normal+Amnesia | Normal+Persist | Privacy+Amnesia | Privacy+Persist |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Local LLM chat | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| BUILD_APP via local stub | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| BUILD_APP via Claude CLI | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ slow | ✓ slow |
| Voice (Whisper / Kokoro) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Wallpaper / SET_WM / SHELL | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| GPU acceleration | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Cloud APIs | ✓ fast | ✓ fast | ✓ slow | ✓ slow |
| OAuth | ✓ | ✓ | ⚠ may be blocked | ⚠ may be blocked |
| Chromium browser windows | ✓ | ✓ | ⚠ v1.0 gap | ⚠ v1.0 gap |

(✓ = works. ⚠ = works with caveat. ✗ = wipes on reboot by design.)

---

## Phase 0 — Scaffold ✅ DONE

- [x] Directory `packages/os/linux/`
- [x] README + PLAN + docs/
- [x] Tails source copied to `tails/`
- [x] Justfile

---

## Phase 1 — Base ISO builds + boots ✅ DONE

Goal: the build pipeline runs against our Tails tree and produces a
bootable ISO indistinguishable from upstream Tails.

**Spec:** [`docs/build-infrastructure.md`](./docs/build-infrastructure.md)

- [x] Containerized build pipeline — `Dockerfile`, `build.sh`,
  `build-iso.sh`, `acng.conf`, `Justfile` (recipes `build` / `build-fast` /
  `config` / `binary` / `nspawn` / `boot` / `clean` / `cache-clean`)
- [x] `apt-cacher-ng` wired in — required (Tails' chroot has Tor-only DNS
  that's dead at build time; apt reaches packages via the proxy by IP) and
  it caches downloads so rebuilds are fast
- [x] 6 Tails Trixie-compat fixes (builder-box interface naming, `ifupdown`,
  `isc-dhcp-client`, `qemu-guest-agent`, vagrant agent channel, and
  `gdisk`/`mtools` for the partitioning initramfs hook)
- [x] `lb config` go/no-go passes in the container
- [x] Full `lb build` produced a finished `.iso` in `out/`
- [x] Boot the ISO in QEMU via `-cdrom`; confirm Tails greeter appears
- [x] **Success**: base ISO boots to the upstream Tails greeter

---

## Phase 2 — Rebrand the greeter to elizaOS (system-level UI) 🔨 IN PROGRESS

Goal: Tails greeter still does its job, but visually it's elizaOS.

**Spec:** [`docs/specs/phase-2-rebrand.md`](./docs/specs/phase-2-rebrand.md)
— enumerates every file (greeter title/logo/CSS, boot menu, Plymouth,
GNOME theme, wallpaper, `os-release`, `issue`), the real elizaOS asset
sources, and the hard "do not rename" list (apt sources, `/usr/share/doc/tails`,
`TAILS_*` keys, session-wired filenames).

- [x] Greeter: window title → "Welcome to elizaOS!", header logo, dark CSS
- [x] Boot menu title "Tails" → "elizaOS" (GRUB + syslinux)
- [x] Plymouth theme → elizaOS wordmark
- [x] GNOME default → dark elizaOS theme
- [x] Default wallpaper + screensaver background → elizaOS
- [x] `/etc/os-release` → `elizaos-tails` identity (keep all `TAILS_*` keys)
- [x] `/etc/issue` MOTD → elizaOS
- [x] **Tails attribution**: About/legal credits and
  `/usr/share/doc/elizaos-tails/CREDITS`
- [ ] Boot ISO in QEMU, confirm elizaOS primary branding and legal/about
  attribution

Brand assets are pre-rendered (greeter logo, about logo, Plymouth wordmark,
wallpaper, screensaver bg) from real elizaOS sources.

---

## Phase 3 — Privacy-mode toggle (boot-menu pick) 🔨 OVERLAY IMPLEMENTED

Goal: Two boot menu entries flip Tor routing on/off. Both produce the same
elizaOS product surface, with speed/provider caveats documented.

**Spec:** [`docs/specs/phase-3-privacy-mode.md`](./docs/specs/phase-3-privacy-mode.md)

- [x] `lib/live/config/0001-elizaos-privacy-mode` — reads the privacy
  kernel cmdline flag (`elizaos_privacy=1`, with compatibility for
  `elizaos.privacy=on`) → writes `/etc/elizaos/privacy-mode`; malformed
  values fail closed to privacy/Tor mode
- [x] `etc/ferm/ferm-direct.conf` — permissive firewall (Tor NAT-redirects
  dropped), the `privacy=off` counterpart to Tails' Tor-only `ferm.conf`
- [x] `dispatcher.d/00-firewall.sh` + `10-tor.sh` branch on the flag
- [x] Boot entries: GRUB (`grub.cfg` edit) + syslinux (`10-syslinux_customize`)
- [x] resolv.conf handled per-mode
- [ ] Test both boot entries in QEMU; confirm direct + Tor traffic

---

## Phase 4 — Bake the elizaOS app into the ISO 🔨 OVERLAY IMPLEMENTED

Goal: `/opt/elizaos/` exists in the chroot, contains a runnable binary.

**Spec:** [`docs/specs/phase-4-bake-elizaos-app.md`](./docs/specs/phase-4-bake-elizaos-app.md)
— the real build sequence, the `9100-install-elizaos` hook design, and the
runtime-package validation direction.

- [x] `just elizaos-app` recipe — builds the current desktop app package on the host
  (the build needs the `eliza`-first install + `setup-upstreams.mjs` +
  `ELIZAOS_ELIZA_SOURCE=local` dance — a naive `bun run build:desktop` fails)
- [x] Stage the app tree into `tails/config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/elizaos/elizaos-app/`
  (`.gitignore`'d — it is ~2.5–2.9 GB uncompressed, far too large to commit)
- [x] `tails/config/chroot_local-hooks/9100-install-elizaos` — installs to
  `/opt/elizaos/`, guards `version.json`, fixes perms incl. `chrome-sandbox`
  setuid, then `rm -rf`'s the staging copy (critical for ISO size)
- [x] Runtime package support lives in `tails-common.list` plus the staged
  app bundle. There is no committed `elizaos-runtime.list` in the current
  tree; production should replace this with a generated, audited package
  manifest instead of stale docs.
- [x] Static `usr/share/applications/elizaos.desktop`
- [x] Build ISO, boot, launch the elizaOS app, confirm app services in QEMU
  on the prior validated artifact
- [ ] Repeat for current HEAD after the latest branding/docs polish

⚠ **Top risk**: the app tree is ~2.9 GB uncompressed (`eliza-dist/` alone is
2.2 GB) — much larger than first estimated. The resulting ISO could be
3–4 GB. And `chrome-sandbox` under Tails' AppArmor + read-only squashfs is
the most likely "boots but won't render" failure (`--no-sandbox` fallback
documented). See the spec and release-path risk section.

---

## Phase 5 — Auto-launch the elizaOS app on greeter exit 🔨 OVERLAY IMPLEMENTED

Goal: after the greeter exits, GNOME comes up with the elizaOS app as the
first window and keeps it available as the home agent without hiding the
normal desktop.

**Spec:** [`docs/specs/phase-5-6-autolaunch-and-agent.md`](./docs/specs/phase-5-6-autolaunch-and-agent.md)
— mostly config, not code: the current implementation uses root-owned systemd
supervision plus live-user services.

- [x] `etc/systemd/system/elizaos.path` + `elizaos.service` — root-owned
  system service starts when the live user session bus appears, runs
  the app as `amnesia`, and restarts it if it exits
- [x] live-user systemd services — start the agent, renderer, and app shell
  using `/usr/local/bin/elizaos` and elizaOS launch helpers
- [x] `/usr/local/bin/elizaos` — pins `ELIZA_STATE_DIR=/home/amnesia/.eliza`
  plus XDG dirs in the launch env and uses a lock to avoid duplicate app
  instances
- [x] `etc/dconf/db/local.d/00_Tails_defaults` — light elizaOS theme, wallpaper,
  disable GNOME welcome dialog (don't clobber Tails' `enabled-extensions`)
- [x] chroot hook runs `dconf update`
- [x] Verify in QEMU on prior artifact: boot → greeter → Start → GNOME →
  elizaOS app/services
- [ ] Repeat for current HEAD

---

## Phase 6 — Wire app onboarding + agent on elizaOS Live 🔨 PARTIAL OS OVERLAY

Goal: the same elizaOS app stack that runs on desktop runs on this live USB.

**Spec:** [`docs/specs/phase-5-6-autolaunch-and-agent.md`](./docs/specs/phase-5-6-autolaunch-and-agent.md).

This is **not "one code delta" — it is real product integration work.**
The live image has to align the Electrobun/CEF runtime, embedded Bun
agent, plugin package graph, `~/.eliza` state, model/provider defaults,
and Tails' live-user session. The demo branch includes explicit runtime
guards/fallbacks; production needs cleaner package boundaries and a
security review of every privileged capability.

- [ ] Replace demo-only package/runtime fallbacks with first-class
  production package boundaries where needed
- [x] Decide the canonical state dir (`~/.eliza`) + env prefix for the
  OS-side launch path: `/usr/local/bin/elizaos` exports `ELIZA_STATE_DIR`,
  `ELIZAOS_STATE_DIR`, `ELIZAOS_*`, and `ELIZAOS_CAPABILITY_RUNNER`
- [ ] `~/.eliza` works in amnesia (tmpfs) and persistent (LUKS bind-mount)
- [ ] Verify BUILD_APP (stub + Claude backends), OPEN_APP, local LLM on GPU,
  the v36 3-question onboarding running in chat

---

## Phase 7 — Persistent USB integration (Tails-native) 🔨 OVERLAY IMPLEMENTED

Goal: user opts into LUKS persistence via the greeter; elizaOS app data
survives reboots; **no Tails persistence code is modified, only added
configuration**.

**Spec:** [`docs/specs/phase-7-persistence.md`](./docs/specs/phase-7-persistence.md)
— note: this Tails release uses the modern **Persistent Storage (`tps`)**
stack, not the legacy `tails-persistence-setup`. Footprint is tiny.

- [x] One `ElizaOSData` `Feature` subclass in `tps/configuration/features.py`
  (bindings for `~/.eliza`, `~/.elizaos`, `~/.config/elizaos`,
  `enabled_by_default=True`)
- [x] One UI row in `features_view.ui.in` (required or the frontend crashes)
- [x] One on-activated hook (wipe stale runtime/cache and singleton lock state)
- [ ] 2 thin agent chat actions ("save my work…", "what's on my storage?")
  that shell Tails' GUI — do NOT reimplement LUKS
- [ ] Verify in QEMU with a multi-partition virtual USB

---

## Phase 8 — Mode-parity validation 📋 SPEC'D

Goal: all 4 combos work the same. Anything that doesn't = documented gap.

**Spec:** [`docs/specs/phase-8-mode-parity-harness.md`](./docs/specs/phase-8-mode-parity-harness.md)
— a `mode-parity.sh` orchestrator for this distro's QEMU and USB-image
paths.

- [ ] `scripts/mode-parity.sh` + `scripts/mode-parity-checklist.sh`
- [ ] Boots all 4 `{amnesia,persistent}×{normal,privacy}` combos through
  one shared checklist, diffs them, emits `parity-report.md`
- [ ] `just mode-parity` recipe
- [ ] Fold findings into `docs/mode-parity.md`

---

## Phase 9 — Rice / customization actions 📋 SPEC'D

Goal: "Install i3", "switch tiling", "swipe-down-for-notis" — all through
chat with elizaOS orchestrating Linux underneath.

**Spec:** [`docs/specs/phase-9-customization-actions.md`](./docs/specs/phase-9-customization-actions.md)
— most substrate already exists (`INSTALL_PACKAGE` + its confirmation
flow, `OPEN_TERMINAL`, `SET_WALLPAPER`).

- [ ] `SHELL` action — a thin gating layer over existing install intent plus
  the elizaOS capability broker. Passwordless apt sudoers/polkit overlays are
  not accepted in the current security model.
- [ ] `SET_DESKTOP`, `THEME`, `NOTIFICATIONS` actions (compose the existing
  install flow)
- [ ] Shared `customization.ts` persistence-awareness helper
- [ ] `docs/customization-vocabulary.md`

---

## Phase 10 — Bare-metal USB validation ⏳ NOT STARTED

- [x] Write ISO to real USB with guarded writer and readback verification
  for prior artifact
- [ ] Repeat USB write/readback for current HEAD
- [ ] Boot on real hardware (2–3 machines: Intel, AMD, NVIDIA GPU)
- [ ] Verify all Phase 1–9 features work bare-metal
- [ ] Verify persistence flow on a real USB stick
- [ ] Verify GPU acceleration on real graphics cards

---

## Phase 11 — Release v1.0 ⏳ NOT STARTED

- [ ] Doc polish, CREDITS, license bundle, and Tails attribution audit
- [ ] License audit (every file: authored vs. Tails-derived)
- [ ] SBOM generation for OS packages and bundled app/runtime payload
- [ ] Release manifest format for ISO, checksums, model catalog, and
  app/runtime bundle metadata
- [ ] Signing/provenance decision: production keys if ready; otherwise mark
  artifacts test-signed and not production-complete
- [ ] Build reproducibility/provenance check: source revision, dependency
  snapshot, builder image, artifact hashes, and signing event recorded
- [ ] Recovery docs for app/runtime fallback, model deletion, failed USB
  writes, failed OS update, and Persistent Storage migration failure
- [ ] Confirm distribution docs accurately label missing fast-update,
  enterprise mirror/policy, rollback, and OS delta infrastructure as demo
  debt if still unimplemented
- [ ] Cut release tag and attach artifacts only after the above status is
  explicit in release notes
- [ ] Open a Discussions thread for v1.1 priorities

---

## Deferred / future (v1.x and beyond)

### Install-to-internal-disk mode (DEFERRED, considering carefully)

> "Make this my main computer. Wipe my drive, install elizaOS on it."
> — would let users use elizaOS as a daily-driver Linux,
> trading the live-USB constraints for full hardware speed + storage.

**Why deferred and being considered with respect for Tails' design**:

Tails refuses to install itself to disk by design. Their reasoning:
- **Disk = traceable**. Log files, swap, fsync'd writes leave forensic
  evidence that contradicts Tails' "leave no trace" promise.
- **Live-USB enforces good habits**. If everything wipes on reboot,
  users naturally treat each session as fresh.
- **The threat model assumes adversaries with physical access**, who
  could analyze a disk image but not a powered-off RAM stick.

We respect that reasoning. An elizaOS ISO that defaults to amnesia
inherits the same forensic protection. Tails users picked Tails
specifically because there's no disk install option — adding one
without thought betrays that choice.

**That said**: elizaOS Live's target audience is broader than Tails'. Many
users want "AI Linux as my daily driver" without needing
amnesia-on-laptop. For them, install-to-disk would be a real product.

Before we add it, we need a real design RFC covering: the threat model
when installed, default full-disk encryption, the dual-boot story, the
install UX (Calamares vs. an elizaOS app flow), and the Tails community
pulse on the derivative. **Planned target: v2.0**, after v1.0 ships and
real users tell us what they want. **For now: don't add it.**

### Embedded web/OAuth proxy patches (v1.1)

Closes the Privacy Mode embedded-web gap. Patch the active app shell/runtime
to inject an explicit Tor proxy into any external web/OAuth surface when
`elizaos.privacy=on`. If CEF/Electrobun is active, that likely means
`--proxy-server=socks5://127.0.0.1:9050`; if WebKit is active, it needs the
equivalent WebKit/network-context proof.

### Runtime privacy toggle (v1.2 or later)

Switch privacy modes mid-session without reboot. iptables atomic swap +
tor.service start/stop + Chromium re-proxy.

### Cross-distro install medium (post-v2.0)

`.deb`, `.AppImage`, Flatpak packaging. Lower priority — the live-USB IS
the product.

---

## Risk inventory

1. **Tails build latent bugs** — every build run so far surfaced a real
   Trixie-compat bug. 6 found + fixed; more may surface in the chroot
   hooks / binary stage. The containerized loop + `apt-cacher-ng` cache
   makes each iteration fast.
2. **ISO size** — the current app tree is ~2.9 GB uncompressed. On top of
   Tails (~1.3 GB squashfs) the ISO could be 3–4 GB. Mitigations: the
   `9100` hook must `rm -rf` the staging copy; consider a slimmer build
   profile; re-measure and budget. See Phase 4 spec.
3. **`chrome-sandbox` under AppArmor + squashfs** — the likely "boots but
   the elizaOS app won't render" failure. `--no-sandbox` is the documented
   fallback.
4. **Phase 6 is real product integration** — not a quick edit. CEF,
   embedded Bun, bundled plugins, model/provider defaults, state dirs, and
   supervised OS capabilities all have to agree inside the live-user
   session. The in-session model helps, but it still needs proof.
5. **Desktop app build fragility** — the desktop build needs a specific
   `eliza`-first + `setup-upstreams.mjs` + `ELIZAOS_ELIZA_SOURCE=local`
   sequence; a naive `bun run build:desktop` fails. Encoded in `just elizaos-app`.
6. **Large monorepo bloat** — the vendored `tails/` tree is ~6000 files.
   PR maintainers may push back; submodule pattern is the fallback.
7. **Tor blocking cloud APIs** — Anthropic/OpenAI often refuse Tor exit
   IPs. In Privacy Mode cloud chat may fail; local LLM still works.
8. **Embedded web/OAuth proxy gap (v1.0)** — live OS routing exists, but
   embedded browser/OAuth surfaces are not production-claimable in Privacy
   Mode until explicit proxy behavior is proven.
9. **Cold-boot RAM attacks** — theoretical threat against amnesia. Tails'
   `memlockd` zeros RAM on shutdown; we keep it.

---

## Open questions

- **Which Tails release tag to track?** Currently a Tails `stable` clone.
  Pin in `tails/debian/changelog`; document upgrade cadence.
- **Vendored `tails/` git strategy** — the vendored copy ships without
  `.git`; `build-iso.sh` `git init`s a throwaway repo at build time so
  the build works either way. Long-term: keep as committed files, or
  convert to a submodule of an elizaOS Tails fork. Decide before v1.0.
- **Default browser in Normal Mode** — Tor Browser doesn't fit direct
  internet. Or: no browser, elizaOS opens links in app-mode windows.
- **Canonical state dir + env prefix** — elizaOS Live should standardize
  on `~/.eliza` for product state while supporting existing app/runtime
  paths (`~/.elizaos`) until the app package is renamed.

## How to contribute

The build needs only Docker. From this directory:

```
just config        # ~1 min go/no-go — does the Tails config tree process?
just build         # full clean ISO → out/  (~1–1.5 h cold, faster cached)
just binary        # ~10 min incremental rebuild after editing overlay files
just nspawn        # seconds — boot the built chroot for non-GUI sanity
just boot          # boot the latest ISO in QEMU
```

Pick a phase, read its spec in `docs/specs/`, implement against the
vendored `tails/` tree, validate with `just binary` + `just boot`.
Exploratory work until Phase 10 ships a real v1.0 ISO that boots on bare
metal.
