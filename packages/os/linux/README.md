# elizaOS Live

elizaOS Live is the canonical elizaOS Debian fork and bootable USB Linux
distribution. It uses Tails' live-OS plumbing for the hard parts of
amnesia, Tor mode, MAC spoofing, AppArmor, persistence, and live-build, but
the primary boot, greeter, and desktop experience are branded as
**elizaOS Live**. Tails attribution is kept in credits, license files, and
engineering docs; users should not see derivative branding as the main
product identity.

The product boots into a normal GNOME desktop with the bundled elizaOS app
as the home surface. Users choose storage behavior and network privacy per
boot: amnesia or encrypted USB persistence, and direct networking or Tor
Privacy Mode.

## Product scope

**USB-only** distribution. Boot from a USB stick. **Pick one of two
storage modes at boot, optionally combine with Tor privacy mode**.

### Storage modes (chosen at the greeter, every boot)

|  | What user gets | What survives reboot |
|---|---|---|
| **Amnesia** (default) | RAM-only user state; no persistence unlocked | Nothing — fresh every time |
| **Persistent USB** (opt-in) | LUKS-encrypted partition on the same USB stick, bind-mounted to `~/.eliza/` and friends | Preserves chat history, built apps, model downloads, Wi-Fi, API keys; VM USB-image persistence creation is validated, physical USB persistence validation is still pending |

A returning user can pick a different mode per-boot. The greeter
shows the same window every time; the persistence row either offers
"Create" (first-time) or shows a passphrase field (returning).
Skip the passphrase → amnesia for that boot, persisted data stays
sealed.

### Privacy mode (chosen at the boot menu, independent of storage)

|  | What user gets |
|---|---|
| **Normal** (default) | Direct internet. Fast cloud APIs, fast model downloads. |
| **Privacy Mode** (opt-in) | Tor-routed networking. Slow but anonymous where supported. Same product surface, with the current embedded web/OAuth caveat below. |

The target contract is that all four combinations work with the same
feature surface, except for speed and persistence. QEMU has proven the
normal branded greeter/desktop/app path and virtual USB-image Persistent
Storage creation on the latest validated artifact, but physical USB boot,
physical USB persistence, and Privacy Mode network behavior still
need validation before those rows can be treated as production evidence. See
[`docs/user-experience.md`](./docs/user-experience.md) for the boot-time
walkthrough and [`docs/mode-parity.md`](./docs/mode-parity.md) for the
acceptance matrix.

## What we're NOT shipping in v1.0

- **Install to internal disk** — deferred to v2.0. The upstream live-OS
  design refuses this for forensic reasons; we're considering it carefully.
  See `PLAN.md § Deferred`.
- **Runtime privacy toggle** — switching modes requires reboot in v1.0.
- **Claiming embedded web/OAuth Privacy Mode parity** — known v1.0 gap.
  The live OS routing is present, but embedded browser and OAuth surfaces
  need explicit proxy proof before we market them as Tor-safe.
- **Production update infrastructure** — current demo builds still require
  a new ISO for OS/base changes. The production plan is signed app/runtime
  updates in encrypted persistence, signed model downloads, and signed OS
  deltas or full-image fallback. See
  [`docs/distribution-and-updates.md`](./docs/distribution-and-updates.md).
- **End-user GUI USB flasher** — developers can use the guarded
  `just usb-write` path today. Production needs the same removable-disk
  policy in a signed cross-platform flasher.

## Repo Shape

This is the active Linux distro path. The old usbeliza prototype and the
intermediate nested distro wrapper were removed from this branch so the Linux
tree has one source of truth: `packages/os/linux/`. Multi-architecture support
is expressed by build targets and package contracts, not by separate distro
directories.

This is the only elizaOS Linux distribution in the repo. The inherited
upstream tree remains at `tails/` because that name is part of the Tails
live-OS code, AppArmor, persistence, and update contracts; it is not a
separate product or variant.

The user-facing product is **elizaOS Live**. Internal paths that still say
`elizaos` are app/runtime paths and should only be renamed when the app
package itself moves.

## Architecture

We keep the upstream live-OS internals intact and layer elizaOS branding,
the elizaOS app, persistence wiring, and supervised OS capabilities on top.
Tor, AppArmor, MAC spoofing, persistence setup, Plymouth, and the normal
desktop remain preserved. The additions live as new chroot hooks + package
lists + branding overrides.

This matches the `packages/os/android/vendor/eliza/` pattern in this
monorepo (brand vendor tree inside the upstream system's structure).

Primary UI should say elizaOS. Engineering paths may still contain
`tails`, `elizaos`, or upstream filenames because those names are part of
the plumbing and package contracts. Do not rename those paths only for
cosmetic reasons.

## License

GPL-3.0-or-later for the inherited live-OS components. Our additions are
Apache-2.0 where possible, dual-licensed under both where required.

## Status: Demo Branch Versus Production

**Current branch status, 2026-05-22:** this branch has produced local
artifacts that pass QEMU greeter/desktop/app startup validation and virtual
USB-image Persistent Storage creation. The latest validated files are
`out/binary.iso` (`0738eaf5291263de43d5c7cb326ca69bc011bcbd8ddefafe03e023db6310ced9`)
and `out/binary.img` (`ff9f5dc15729164bb115ae73cc4d2d75e43f0b45596227149469971300ce123c`).
Release promotion must rebuild and validate the exact release commit if the
branch moves after the latest tested artifact.
See [`docs/current-status.md`](./docs/current-status.md) for the exact
validation state.

**Phase 1 — done.** The containerized build pipeline produced a bootable
base ISO, and Tails' normal live-OS boot path was verified through QEMU
using `-cdrom`.

**Phases 2–7 — implemented in source, QEMU demo path proven on the latest
validated artifact.** Branding, Privacy Mode plumbing, bundled elizaOS app
install/autostart, the conservative elizaOS capability broker, and elizaOS
Persistent Storage rows/hooks are in the tree. The current gate is physical
USB flash/readback, real hardware boot, reboot persistence, and privacy
validation.

**Phases 8–9 — spec/backlog.** Mode-parity harness and customization
actions are planned but not production-complete. Production also still
needs signed releases, update/rollback infrastructure, a GUI USB flasher,
hardware compatibility evidence, and enterprise policy/audit hardening.
See [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) for the phase map and [`RELEASE_PATH.md`](./RELEASE_PATH.md)
for the road from demo to release.

## Build it

Only requirement is Docker. From this directory:

```
just static-smoke # CPU-light syntax/config checks, no Docker/QEMU
just config    # ~1 min live-build go/no-go
just build     # full clean ISO -> out/
just build-cool # low-CPU demo build, skips offline docs, caps Docker+squashfs to 2 CPUs
just build-demo # fastest full demo build; skips bundled offline website/docs
just boot      # boot the latest ISO in QEMU
just usb-write /dev/sdX # write the latest USB .img with removable-disk guards
```

Set `ELIZAOS_BUILD_CPUS=2`, `ELIZAOS_MKSQUASHFS_PROCESSORS=2`, or
`ELIZAOS_BUILD_MEMORY=8g` when you need Docker to stay out of the way of
Android/AOSP/app builds on the same machine. `just build-cool` sets the
CPU and squashfs caps to 2 by default and skips rebuilding the bundled
offline website/docs; set `ELIZAOS_SKIP_WEBSITE=0` if you need exact
offline docs in a cool build.
