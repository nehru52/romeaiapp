# To address tails#21014 we don't re-run htpdate if it already succeeded.
# In fact, there is no reason to start it another time: the time has been synced already, and we can assume
# that your hardware clock is keeping time after that.
# Please note that it might be tempting to remove the if, and replace "restart" with "start".
# That would be very similar, but not exactly the same: an htpdate instance which is running (and would
# probably fail since it's running through a disconnect-reconnect) would not be stopped by running "start",
# while restart would.
# This does *not* solve the root cause of tails#21014: there is nothing specific about "htpdate has already
# succeeded" as far as we know, and this can be one more way in which time synchronization could fail.
# But it makes the bug far less visible in the test suite.
