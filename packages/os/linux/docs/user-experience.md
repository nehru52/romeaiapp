# User experience flows

Plain-language walkthrough of what users actually see and do. elizaOS Live
uses a proven live-USB welcome-screen pattern, but the visible product is
elizaOS Live. Tails remains credited in the license/about materials and
engineering docs, not as the primary user-facing brand.

**Same greeter window every boot** — the only thing that changes is
whether an encrypted persistence partition has been created on the USB.
Status as of 2026-05-19: this is the intended v1 behavior. The latest local
ISO artifact proved the normal QEMU greeter/desktop/app-service path, including
light elizaOS shell branding and close-to-window-list behavior. Rebuild and
retest the exact release commit if the branch moves, and complete real-USB
persistence/privacy validation before every storage and privacy row below is
marked proven.

## The boot sequence (always the same)

1. **Boot menu** (~3 seconds) — isolinux/grub. Pick:
   - "**elizaOS**" (default) — direct internet, fast
   - "**elizaOS — Privacy Mode**" — Tor routing, slow but anonymous
2. **Plymouth splash** (~10 seconds) — elizaOS wordmark while the
   kernel + initramfs load.
3. **elizaOS greeter** — same GTK window every time.

---

## The greeter window

Always shows the same fields:

```

```

The **Persistent Storage row** is the only thing that shifts between
scenarios.

---

## Scenario A — Brand-new user (first boot, no encryption partition)

Persistent Storage row shows:
```
  Persistent Storage:    [ Create Persistent Storage ]
```

Steps:
1. User accepts defaults, clicks **Start elizaOS**.
2. GNOME desktop loads.
3. The elizaOS app auto-launches as the always-on home window.
4. elizaOS starts the v36 3-question chat onboarding:
   - "Hi. I'm elizaOS. What should I call you?"
   - "Want to sign into Claude?"
   - "Last question. What do you want me to build first?"
5. User chats with elizaOS, builds apps, etc. All in RAM.
6. Power off / unplug → **everything gone**. The USB itself is
   unmodified apart from normal boot media reads; user state is not
   written to the USB.

Optionally during the session, after the agent action exists: user says
"save my work to this USB" -> elizaOS opens the Persistent Storage UI:
- Prompts for an encryption passphrase
- Creates LUKS partition on the USB
- Asks which dirs to persist (`~/.eliza/`, Wi-Fi passwords, etc.)
- On reboot, the user is in Scenario B from now on.

**No password entered at boot. Amnesia mode is the default state for
new users.**

---

## Scenario B — Returning user (persistence exists, user wants continuity)

Persistent Storage row shows:
```
  Persistent Storage:    [_______________ passphrase] [ Unlock ]
```

Steps:
1. User types their passphrase, clicks **Unlock** → LUKS partition
   unlocks, gets bind-mounted to `~/.eliza/`, legacy app state dirs, and
   selected system settings.
2. User clicks **Start elizaOS**.
3. GNOME desktop loads.
4. The elizaOS app auto-launches as the always-on home window. Intended
   persistent behavior: chat history is there, built apps are there,
   downloaded models are there, and Wi-Fi connects automatically. This still
   needs real USB validation.
5. User continues working where they left off.
6. Power off → encrypted partition seals automatically, USB now
   contains an encrypted blob.

**They typed their passphrase once at boot. Everything else is the
same as on their previous session.**

---

## Scenario C — Returning user, but wants amnesia for THIS boot

Same greeter, same persistence row with the passphrase field. The
user **just doesn't type it**.

Steps:
1. User clicks **Start elizaOS** without entering the passphrase.
2. GNOME loads.
3. The elizaOS app auto-launches as the always-on home window. **Fresh state.**
   Onboarding runs from scratch.
   No chat history visible. No persisted apps.
4. User has an amnesia session for this boot.
5. Power off → encrypted partition was never unlocked, stays sealed.
   **Their data is still on the USB**, just untouched by this session.
6. Next boot they can unlock again if they want.

**This is the "give my laptop to a friend for an hour" pattern — they
get a clean session, the friend can't see your stuff, your stuff
survives.**

---

## Privacy Mode (orthogonal to storage mode)

Privacy Mode is picked at the **boot menu** (one step earlier than the
greeter), so it's independent of amnesia / persistent. All 4 combinations
are valid product modes:

```
                  Normal Mode (default)    Privacy Mode (Tor)
                  ─────────────────────    ──────────────────
   Amnesia        "burner with AI"        "burner + anonymity"
   Persistent     "portable AI laptop"    "portable + anonymity"
```

- **Normal Mode** — direct internet. Fast. Anthropic API, OpenAI,
  HuggingFace downloads all at full speed. Default.
- **Privacy Mode** — Tor routing for the live networking stack. Same
  product surface, slower speeds. Cloud APIs may be blocked because
  providers often refuse Tor exits. Local LLM works identically.

The user can pick a different combination on every boot. No commitment.

---

## What survives reboot in each mode

| | Amnesia + Normal | Amnesia + Privacy | Persistent + Normal | Persistent + Privacy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chat history | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Built apps | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Downloaded models | ✗ (re-download next boot) | ✗ (slow re-download via Tor) | ✓ | ✓ |
| Wifi passwords | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI) | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (in LUKS keyring) | ✓ (in LUKS keyring) |
| Onboarding answers | redo every boot | redo every boot | ask once | ask once |
| Wallpaper / theme / WM choice | reset to defaults | reset to defaults | persists | persists |

**Important**: a returning persistent user who chooses Amnesia for one
boot doesn't LOSE their persistent data — it's encrypted on the USB
and sealed. They just don't see it that session.

---

## What's intended to be identical across all four combos

This is the target v1.0 contract. The current HEAD has QEMU proof for boot,
greeter, desktop, app launch, and close/minimize UX. USB hardware,
Persistent Storage, and privacy routing validation are still required before
these rows can be treated as production-verified behavior.

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Local LLM chat (Ollama / node-llama-cpp) | ✓ identical, no network needed |
| BUILD_APP via local stub | ✓ identical |
| BUILD_APP via Claude (signed-in) | ✓ identical (slower via Tor) |
| OPEN_APP (Chromium windowed apps) | ✓ identical |
| Voice (Whisper STT, Kokoro TTS) | ✓ identical, local |
| Wallpaper / SET_WM / theming | ✓ identical |
| GPU acceleration (NVIDIA / AMD / Intel) | ✓ identical |
| MAC spoofing | ✓ identical (enabled by default, can toggle in greeter) |
| Cloud APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) | Intended, but provider blocks over Tor are expected |

**Known v1.0 gap**: embedded browser/OAuth windows are not yet
production-claimable in Privacy Mode. The elizaOS agent path is intended to
respect Tor, but any embedded browser shell needs explicit proxy proof
before we market it as Tor-safe. This is documented in
`docs/privacy-mode-v1-gap.md`.

## What happens on power-off / unplug

### Amnesia mode

- RAM contents physically lost on power-off.
- `memlockd` aggressively zeros RAM on shutdown (upstream live-OS behavior,
  kept).
- No swap partition mounted → no spillover of memory to disk.
- The product goal is no intentional local trace after shutdown. Cold-boot
  RAM attacks are theoretically possible but practically rare.
- USB itself is unchanged — the ISO is read-only on the stick.

### Persistent mode

- LUKS partition seals automatically on power-off.
- RAM contents lost same as amnesia.
- USB physically contains an encrypted blob. Without the passphrase,
  contents are unreadable.
- **If user loses USB** → encrypted data is on the lost device. With
  a strong passphrase, attackers can't read it. **If user forgets
  passphrase** → data is lost permanently. There is no recovery key.

### Installed mode

**Not supported in v1.0.** See `PLAN.md § Deferred` for the rationale —
the upstream live-OS design refuses this by default, and we're considering
it carefully for v2.0 because the threat model implications matter.

---

## How users decide which mode at first boot

The greeter handles it all. Three flows:

1. **First-time users**: amnesia by default. No setup needed.
2. **"I want my work to stick"**: chat with elizaOS -> say "save my
   work to encrypted USB" -> elizaOS opens persistence wizard.
3. **"I just want privacy this once"**: at boot menu, pick "elizaOS —
   Privacy Mode". Independent of persistence.

The choice is **per-boot**. Users can mix and match every session.
Same USB, different decisions, different experiences.

---

## What we're NOT doing in v1.0

- Installing to internal disk (deferred — see PLAN.md § Deferred)
- Runtime privacy toggle without reboot (deferred — boot-menu pick
  is enough for v1.0)
- Closing the embedded browser/OAuth proxy gap (deferred to v1.1)
- Cross-distro packaging (.deb / .AppImage / Flatpak — post-v2.0)

The v1.0 release is intentionally small: **a USB stick that boots into
either amnesia or persistent, with an optional Tor mode, and elizaOS as
the desktop home**. That's the whole product. Everything else is later.
