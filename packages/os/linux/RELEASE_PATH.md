# Release Path — from here to a real, fully-complete elizaOS Live

This is the honest road. `PLAN.md` is the phase map; the `docs/specs/`
are the turn-by-turn directions; **this doc is the realistic schedule,
the critical path, and what "done" actually means.**

No optimism inflation. Where something is risky or unknown, it says so.

---

## Where we are right now (2026-05-19)

**Done and proven:**
- The **containerized build pipeline** works. A full elizaOS ISO
  builds end-to-end in a container and boots as a CD-ROM ISO. No
  Vagrant, no host setup, any-OS, fast incremental rebuilds.
- **6 genuine Tails Trixie-compat bugs** found and fixed along the way.
- **Every implementation phase (2–9) has a source-level spec/backlog.**
- The **elizaOS desktop app builds** (the build sequence is
  fragile but verified and documented).
- Brand assets rendered; build infra clean-code reviewed; the Phase 6
  agent/runtime integration risks are documented.
- Local overlays now exist for elizaOS branding, Privacy Mode, elizaOS app
  install/systemd launch, a conservative elizaOS capability broker, elizaOS
  Persistent Storage, and a checked signed-runtime verifier foundation.
- A recent full ISO artifact passed QEMU through the branded greeter,
  desktop, and app-service path. A prior artifact was flashed to a
  removable USB with guarded write/readback verification.
- The old root-level usbeliza prototype has been removed from this branch;
  the active Linux distro work now lives in this live-build tree.

**Not done:**
- Rebuild and re-run QEMU if the branch moves after the latest validated
  artifact; exact release-commit traceability is required before calling an
  artifact final USB-ready.
- Privacy/direct networking and real USB Persistent Storage behavior still
  need proof inside the rebuilt live OS.
- The app/runtime can inherit elizaOS state/privacy/broker env, but there
  are not yet first-class approval-gated app actions for privileged
  package/network mutation.
- Phases 8–9 are still specs/backlog, not release-complete code.

So: the *build machine* is mostly complete. The *product* — elizaOS Live
— has the core overlays in place, but the next heavy gate is still a
exact release-commit rebuild if needed + QEMU + real USB boot +
mode/persistence validation.

Product identity rule: the boot, greeter, and desktop should read as
elizaOS Live. Tails remains the underlying live-OS plumbing and is credited
in license/about docs, but it should not be the visible primary brand.

---

## The two milestones

### Milestone A — "Demo-able" (an elizaOS-branded OS that boots)

**Phases 1 + 2 plus app launch proof.** A USB-bootable ISO that says
elizaOS everywhere — boot menu, Plymouth splash, greeter, wallpaper,
`os-release` — and automatically starts the bundled elizaOS app as a
normal desktop window. Boots in QEMU and on real hardware. The local tree
also contains privacy/persistence/broker overlays, but this milestone only
claims demo readiness after the app stays running in the rebuilt image.

- Effort: Phase 1 finish (~hours, mostly build iteration) + Phase 2
  (~1–2 days — config-only, validated with `just binary` ~10 min/cycle).
- Risk: low. Phase 2 is additive branding; the build pipeline is proven.
- **This is the realistic near-term demo.**

### Milestone B — "v1.0 fully complete" (the real product)

**Phases 1–11.** elizaOS is the desktop. You boot the USB, land in the
elizaOS app, chat with Eliza, build apps, run the local LLM or a signed
cloud/model provider, open windows — in all 4 storage×privacy combos,
with encrypted persistence, validated on real hardware, and released with
honest signing, provenance, recovery, and distribution docs. Fast
app/runtime updates, signed model catalogs, OS delta updates, and enterprise
mirrors can land as staged v1.x capabilities, but v1.0 must not imply they
are production-complete until their keys, services, manifests, and rollback
tests exist.

- Effort: **multi-week.** The honest breakdown is below.
- Risk: medium-high, concentrated in Phases 4 and 6 (see Risk section).

## Critical path (the order things must happen)

```
Phase 1 ──> Phase 2 ──┬──> Phase 3 ─────────────────┐
(build +    (rebrand) │    (privacy toggle)         │
 boot)                │                             ├──> Phase 8 ──> Phase 10 ──> Phase 11
                      ├──> Phase 4 ──> Phase 5 ──> Phase 6 ──> Phase 7 ──> Phase 9 ┘
                      │    (bake app)  (autolaunch) (wire     (persist)  (rice)
                      │                             agent)
                      └─ Phases 3, 4, 7 touch mostly disjoint files —
                         parallelizable once Phase 2 lands.
```

- **Phase 1 → 2** is strictly sequential — need a booting base first.
- **Phase 2 → 3** share the boot-menu files (GRUB/syslinux) — do them
  in sequence, not parallel.
- **Phase 4 → 5 → 6** is a hard chain — autolaunch needs the app present,
  agent-wiring needs autolaunch.
- **Phase 6 → 7** — persistence verification needs a working agent to
  prove `~/.eliza` survives.
- **Phase 8** (mode-parity) needs everything before it; it's the gate.
- **Phases 3, 4, 7** are the parallelizable cluster — disjoint file sets.
- **Phase 9** (rice actions) can slot in any time after Phase 6.

## Realistic effort

| Phase | What | Effort | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Base ISO builds + boots | hours (build iteration) | high — pipeline proven |
| 2 | Rebrand OS to elizaOS | 1–2 days | high — config only |
| 3 | Privacy-mode toggle | overlay present; validation still needed | medium — firewall ordering is subtle |
| 4 | Bake the elizaOS app | overlay/payload present; validation still needed | **low** — ~2.9 GB tree, ISO-size + chrome-sandbox unknowns |
| 5 | Auto-launch | overlay present; validation still needed | high — mostly config |
| 6 | Wire the agent | OS env/broker partial; shared-agent work still **1–2 weeks** | **low-medium** — real refactor, see audit |
| 7 | Persistence | overlay present; validation still needed | high — Tails-native, tiny footprint |
| 8 | Mode-parity harness + run | ~1 week | medium — tedious QEMU automation, no longer shared with the removed prototype |
| 9 | Customization actions | 1 week | medium — substrate exists |
| 10 | Bare-metal validation | 3–5 days | medium — hardware quirks |
| 11 | Release | 2–3 days | high |

**Honest total to Milestone B: ~6–9 weeks of focused work**, with Phases
4 and 6 being where it could blow out. Milestone A: **~2–3 days** once
Phase 1's build is confirmed booting.

## What "fully complete" actually means (the v1.0 definition of done)

elizaOS Live v1.0 is done when **all of this is true on real hardware**:

1. The ISO `dd`'s to a USB stick and boots on 2–3 real machines (Intel,
   AMD, NVIDIA).
2. Boot menu offers "elizaOS" and "elizaOS — Privacy Mode"; everything in
   the primary OS path is elizaOS-branded; Tails is credited in
   About/CREDITS/license materials, not as the main boot or greeter brand.
3. After the greeter, the elizaOS app launches as the desktop and the v36
   3-question onboarding runs in chat.
4. Eliza works: local LLM chat (GPU-accelerated), BUILD_APP (stub +
   Claude), OPEN_APP, SET_WALLPAPER, the customization actions.
5. Persistent mode: create encrypted storage via the greeter; chat
   history, built apps, models, Wi-Fi, API keys survive a reboot.
6. Amnesia mode: user state does not persist and no persistence volume is
   unlocked.
7. Privacy mode: supported traffic routes through Tor; Normal mode:
   direct. Embedded browser/OAuth caveats are disclosed until fixed.
8. **All 4 storage×privacy combos behave identically** except speed and
   trace footprint — proven by the Phase 8 harness, every gap documented.
9. The known v1.0 embedded web/OAuth Privacy Mode gap is documented, not
   silent.
10. The baked ISO runtime is documented as the factory fallback; any
    persistent runtime update path is either disabled or protected by
    boot-time signature/hash verification before activation.
11. Signed model catalog/download behavior is either implemented and tested
    or explicitly documented as release debt; no large/private model is
    silently assumed to be present in the ISO.
12. License audit done; CREDITS/NOTICE complete; release artifacts are
    signed or clearly marked test-signed, with SBOM/provenance status
    documented.

Anything short of that isn't v1.0 — it's a milestone on the way.

---

## The risks that could actually blow the timeline

1. **ISO size (Phase 4).** The elizaOS app tree is ~2.9 GB uncompressed.
   On top of Tails the ISO could hit 3–4 GB. Mitigation work (slim build
   profile, aggressive squashfs) may be needed and isn't scoped yet.
2. **`chrome-sandbox` under AppArmor + squashfs (Phase 4).** The likely
   "boots but elizaOS won't render" failure. `--no-sandbox` is the
   fallback but weakens the renderer on a security-focused OS.
3. **App/agent OS integration is real product work, not verification.**
   The app boots from a live image only if Electron/CEF, embedded Bun,
   plugins, persistence paths, and model/provider defaults all agree with
   Tails' live-user environment. The demo has targeted workarounds for
   some of this; the release path needs cleaner package boundaries.
4. **elizaOS app build fragility.** The desktop build needs an exact
   `eliza`-first + `setup-upstreams.mjs` + `ELIZAOS_ELIZA_SOURCE=local`
   sequence. If the app repo's lockfile/dist-tag state drifts, the
   `just elizaos-app` recipe breaks. Worth fixing upstream.
5. **Latent Tails Trixie bugs.** Every build run so far surfaced one.
   The chroot-hooks and binary stages are now proven, but Phase 2+'s
   overlay changes could surface more.
6. **Tor blocking cloud APIs (Phase 8).** Anthropic/OpenAI refuse Tor
   exit IPs — in Privacy Mode, cloud features degrade to local-only.
   This is expected and documented, not a bug, but it shapes what
   "parity" means.

---

## Immediate next steps (in order)

1. **Rebuild current HEAD.** The already-flashed USB predates later
   SVG/icon/string polish.
2. **QEMU visual/runtime pass** — confirm elizaOS boot menu, Plymouth,
   greeter, wallpaper, system identity, app services, close/minimize UX,
   and legal/about attribution.
3. **Mode and persistence pass** — confirm direct/privacy networking,
   conservative broker status/root-status, and Persistent Storage.
4. **Repeat guarded USB write/readback for the rebuilt HEAD artifact**, then
   boot it on real hardware.
5. Continue mode-parity, model onboarding, update
   infrastructure, release signing, and enterprise hardening.

## Product and Distribution Track

The demo ISO is not the whole product. Real distribution needs:

- **Signed releases:** versioned ISO, SHA256/SHA512, detached signatures,
  release notes, SBOM, license bundle, and provenance tying artifact hashes
  to source revision, dependency snapshot, builder identity, and signing
  event.
- **Fast app/runtime updates:** the ISO carries a baked fallback runtime;
  an updated runtime in encrypted persistence is selected only after
  boot-time signature/hash verification against a signed manifest. Failed
  verification falls back to the ISO runtime.
- **Model delivery:** do not bake large/private models into every ISO by
  default. Onboarding should offer cloud sign-in, local-only mode, or a
  signed Eliza-1 download cached in persistent storage. The model catalog
  needs signed metadata, hashes, license/source information, hardware
  requirements, revocation, and enterprise mirror support.
- **OS/base update path:** signed full ISO plus guarded writer is the safe
  first production path; signed Tails-style incremental kits or binary
  deltas are v1.x work where they are safer than full-image replacement.
- **USB writer UX:** keep the guarded CLI script for developers, then add
  the same removable-disk checks to a signed macOS/Windows/Linux flasher
  so users can create or refresh an elizaOS USB without depending on
  Etcher.
- **Enterprise channel:** staged rollout rings, revocation, policy pins,
  internal mirrors for ISO/delta/app/model artifacts, recovery image,
  hardware compatibility notes, persistent-storage migrations, and
  non-secret fleet evidence.
- **Recovery and rollback:** runtime rollback to previous persistent
  version or ISO fallback, model rollback/deletion, OS full-image fallback,
  and tested Persistent Storage migration failure handling.
- **Demo debt accounting:** release docs must say which of the above are
  implemented, test-signed, or still planned. Do not present enterprise
  mirrors/policy, production keys, app update channels, model catalogs, or
  OS deltas as complete until they exist.
