# Parameterized Pixel product makefile for elizaOS.
#
# Per-codename wrappers (eliza_oriole_phone.mk, eliza_panther_phone.mk,
# eliza_shiba_phone.mk, ...) set ELIZA_PIXEL_CODENAME and inherit this
# file. The codename inherit-product line resolves to whichever AOSP
# manifest tag was synced; on `android-latest-release` the Pixel device
# trees only appear during specific release windows, so a `lunch` failure
# pointing at this line means the AOSP checkout doesn't carry the device
# tree for that codename — re-init `repo` against an AOSP tag that does.
