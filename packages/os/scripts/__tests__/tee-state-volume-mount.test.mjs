// Fail-closed mount-hook tests for the attestation-bound sealed state volume
// (plan §3.5a; OS half of the agent ↔ OS sealed-volume contract).
//
// The hook obtains the volume key through the agent contract
// (packages/agent/src/services/tee-sealed-volume.ts `unsealStateVolumeKey`,
// injected here as `unsealKey`) and drives `cryptsetup luksOpen` + `mount`. The
// security property under test is the OS-side fail-closed behavior:
//
//   1. On a RELEASED key, the hook invokes cryptsetup luksOpen with the key on
//      stdin, then mounts the mapper device.
//   2. On a WITHHELD key (the agent contract rejects), the hook makes NO
//      cryptsetup/mount call and surfaces the rejection (no host-readable
//      fallback).
//   3. On a key-release THROW (boot gate blocks secrets / untrusted decision),
//      the hook refuses to mount.
//   4. A "successful" release that is not a 32-byte hex key is itself refused
//      before any cryptsetup call.
//
// Real dm-crypt unlock needs the confidential guest (BLOCKED on hardware); the
// key-binding + fail-closed logic is what is tested locally via an injected
// runner so no real device is touched.
//
// Runner (canonical for OS scripts; bun test is unstable for these .mjs):
//   node --test packages/os/scripts/__tests__/tee-state-volume-mount.test.mjs
