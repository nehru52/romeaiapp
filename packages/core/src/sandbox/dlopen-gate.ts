/**
 * `bun:ffi.dlopen()` gate for store-distributed builds.
 *
 * Mac App Store distribution requires the hardened-runtime entitlement
 * `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` to be **false**: every
 * Mach-O the process loads must be signed by Apple or by the same Team ID
 * that signed the app. The OS enforces this at `dlopen()` time, so any code
 * path that calls into `bun:ffi`'s `dlopen()` with a non-bundle-local path
 * fails at runtime in store builds (and is a sandbox-escape vector in worst
 * cases).
 *
 * This module is the runtime-side counterpart to that entitlement. Every
 * call site that touches `bun:ffi.dlopen()` (or a wrapper around it) MUST
 * call {@link assertDlopenPathAllowed} immediately before the load. The
 * gate is a **hard assertion** in store builds — it throws — and is bypassed
 * in direct builds where the user owns the install and we trust the filesystem.
 *
 * What "bundle-local" means on macOS: the resolved absolute library path
 * must live under `<...>/<Name>.app/Contents/` (covers
 * `Contents/MacOS`, `Contents/Resources`, `Contents/Frameworks`, and any
 * other bundle sub-directory).
 *
 * Out of scope:
 * - `node-llama-cpp`, etc. — these load native modules
 *   through Node's `process.dlopen` / `require()`-driven `.node` loader,
 *   not through `bun:ffi`. They are governed separately by the Node
 *   loader's own search path and by signing on the bundled `.node`
 *   artifacts.
 * - Non-darwin platforms — this gate enforces the macOS App Sandbox
 *   library-validation rule only. Linux/Windows distribution constraints use
 *   their own loader and signing policies.
