/**
 * Interactive message protocol — the connector-agnostic engine for parsing,
 * serializing, and laying out the interaction blocks an agent embeds in a reply
 * (forms, choice pickers, suggestion chips, task cards, secret requests).
 *
 * Types live in `@elizaos/core` `types/interactions`; this module is the pure
 * runtime: shared by the dashboard, the connectors, and the runtime's outbound
 * normalization. No React, no Node-only APIs.
