/**
 * Detect fabricated content-moderation / policy-enforcement claims in
 * model-generated `replyText`.
 *
 * Background: the system prompt forbids attributing a refusal or the agent's own
 * behavior to a moderation system, content filter, "usage policies", "safety
 * guidelines", or an automatic block that does not actually exist in this
 * runtime (`packages/prompts/src/index.ts`). There is no such enforcer sitting
 * between the agent and the user; inventing one is, in the prompt's words, "a
 * lie about how you work". Hosted planner models nonetheless reach for these
 * excuses when they decline — the same prompt-contract violation class that
 * motivated `looksLikeRefusal` (see `refusal-detector.ts`).
 *
 * This detector is the structural net for that rule. Every pattern requires
 * SELF / POSSESSIVE framing ("our usage policies", "my content filter", "I was
 * blocked", "your request was flagged", "the system blocked your message") so
 * that legitimately discussing a third party's policies ("Stripe's usage
 * policies state ...") or describing a real runtime error ("the request was
 * blocked by CORS") never matches. Matched anywhere in the trimmed text.
 *
 * Note: describing an ACTUAL tool/runtime error this turn is explicitly allowed
 * by the prompt — hence the patterns target invented *moderation* framing, not
 * generic "blocked/failed" language.
 *
 * Use sites: the planning-path reply suppression in `parseMessageHandlerOutput`
 * (`runtime/message-handler.ts`) and `messageHandlerFromFieldResult`
 * (`services/message.ts`), alongside `looksLikeRefusal` and
 * `looksLikeTrainingCutoffLeak`. When a planning path is selected the planner
 * produces the user-facing message, so a fabricated-moderation Stage-1
 * `replyText` is blanked.
