# hetzner/control-plane — Terraform for the eliza Cloud control-plane VMs

This Terraform module manages the **persistent** Hetzner Cloud VM(s) that host
the elizaOS Cloud control-plane:

- `eliza-provisioning-worker` — pulls jobs from the `jobs` table and SSHs
  into sandbox cores
- `eliza-agent-router` — subdomain HTTP routing
- `cloudflared` — secure tunnel for `sandboxes.elizacloud.ai`
- `headscale` — VPN mesh for cross-core agent traffic

The **data plane** (the sandbox cores themselves) is **not** managed here —
those are provisioned and drained at runtime by
[`node-autoscaler.ts`](../../../../../cloud-shared/src/lib/services/containers/node-autoscaler.ts)
which talks to the Hetzner Cloud API directly. See
[`../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full split.

## Prerequisites

1. **Hetzner Cloud project** with API token (`HCLOUD_TOKEN`).
2. **Cloudflare account** with API token + DNS edit on `elizacloud.ai`
   (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`).
3. **Cloudflare R2 bucket** `eliza-terraform-state` for remote state. Generate
   an R2 API token, edit `backend-staging.hcl` / `backend-production.hcl`
   with your CF account ID, then export the R2 token as
   `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` + `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` before `terraform init`.
4. **Terraform >= 1.5.0** locally.

## Bootstrap a brand-new control-plane VM (staging)

```bash
cd packages/cloud-infra/cloud/terraform/hetzner/control-plane

# 1. Pull providers + connect remote state.
terraform init -backend-config=backend-staging.hcl

# 2. Copy + fill tfvars.
cp tfvars/staging.tfvars.example tfvars/staging.tfvars
$EDITOR tfvars/staging.tfvars

# 3. Plan + apply.
export HCLOUD_TOKEN=...
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=...
terraform plan -var-file=tfvars/staging.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=tfvars/staging.tfvars

# 4. Output gives you the VM IP. Copy the cloud env file into place:
scp packages/cloud-shared/.env.local root@<vm-ip>:/opt/eliza/cloud/.env.local

# 5. Trigger first deploy from GitHub Actions
#    (workflow: deploy-eliza-provisioning-worker.yml, manual dispatch).
```

## Adopt the existing production VM into Terraform

The current prod manager VM (`89.167.63.246`, a legacy hand-assigned
hostname) was created by hand in May 2026. To bring it under Terraform
without recreating it, look up the Hetzner Cloud server ID
(`hcloud server list`), then `terraform import 'hcloud_server.control_plane["1"]' <id>`
plus a `terraform import` for each existing `hcloud_ssh_key`. The first
plan after import shows the in-place rename to `eliza-production-1` (the
env-suffixed name), the new labels, and the Cloudflare DNS record creation;
`user_data` and `image`
diffs are suppressed by `lifecycle { ignore_changes }`. One-shot — never
re-run.

## Operational notes

**SSH to the CP — always by public IP, never by hostname.** The Cloudflare DNS
record (`eliza-${env}-N.elizacloud.ai`) is proxied (orange-cloud); CF does not
pass TCP/22, so `ssh root@eliza-staging-1.elizacloud.ai` silently fails. Get the
IP from terraform output:

```bash
terraform output -json control_plane_vms | jq -r '."1".ipv4'
# Or the ready-made command:
terraform output ssh_login_commands
```

**Cloudflare zone SSL mode MUST stay on "Full"** (not "Full (Strict)"). The
control-plane uses a self-signed `*.elizacloud.ai` cert; CF only accepts that
on "Full". Flipping to Strict in the CF dashboard breaks every dashboard
chat call silently with HTTP 526.

**DNS cutover is operator-gated, not automatic.** The control-plane A record
has `lifecycle.ignore_changes = [content]` so `terraform apply` never auto-
flips the IP when a new VM gets created. When the new CP is validated, flip
the record manually via the Cloudflare dashboard (preferred — no NXDOMAIN
window) or via a one-off `terraform state rm` + re-apply round-trip if you
want the new content to land back in state.

**Cloud-init changes need `terraform taint`** to land on existing VMs.
`user_data` is in `lifecycle.ignore_changes` so subsequent applies are
no-ops for an already-provisioned CP. To roll a bootstrap fix, taint the
VM and re-apply — but that wipes local state (headscale DB, cloudflared
creds, /opt/eliza checkout). Plan that out before touching prod.

**Headscale arm/handoff on a CP.** Cloud-init installs the `headscale` package
(binary, systemd unit, `/var/lib/headscale` state dir owned by the package user)
but stops the auto-started service so it does not bind with a fresh empty DB
before the environment is intentionally wired.

For the normal staging/prod path, use the idempotent workflow:

```bash
gh workflow run arm-headscale-control-plane.yml --repo elizaOS/eliza --ref main \
  -f environment=production \
  -f headscale_api_url=http://127.0.0.1:8081 \
  -f listen_addr=127.0.0.1:8081
```

That workflow installs the committed ACL, converges `server_url` and
`listen_addr`, ensures the `agent`/`tunnel` users exist, upserts the daemon's
Headscale env in `/opt/eliza/cloud/.env.local`, restarts both services, and
checks local `/health`. It also converges the last-mile public-edge bits that
used to be hand-run on every CP (and lost on a rebuild — a DR gap):

- the **nginx vhost + Let's Encrypt cert** that front the public headscale URL
  (`/etc/nginx/conf.d/headscale.conf` → `127.0.0.1:<listen-port>`), as a
  no-http2 vhost with `Upgrade`/`Connection` passthrough + 86400s timeouts (the
  TS2021/noise control protocol needs it). Renewal rides certbot's own
  `certbot.timer`. Cert issuance is idempotent (`certbot certonly`, skipped when
  a valid cert already exists).
- the **`cp-<env>-router` tailscale self-enrollment** (`tag:eliza-proxy`, owned
  by the `tunnel` user) so the daemon on the CP can reach agent `tag:agent`
  `100.64.x` IPs. Idempotent (skips if already enrolled).

The matching **DNS record** (`headscale[-staging].elizacloud.ai` → CP ipv4,
`proxied=false`) is managed by this Terraform module (`cloudflare_dns_record.headscale`
in `main.tf`), set the env's FQDN via the `headscale_hostname` tfvar. So the
full chain — DNS, nginx, cert, cp-router — now reproduces from IaC on a clean CP
rebuild (`terraform apply` for DNS, then the arm workflow for the rest). See
[`../../../../../cloud-services/headscale/DEPLOY.md`](../../../../../cloud-services/headscale/DEPLOY.md)
for the required GitHub Environment secrets and the "why" behind each one.

If you are replacing a CP and must preserve an existing tailnet, copy the state
first, then run the arm workflow to converge config and daemon env:

```bash
# From the prior CP
ssh root@PRIOR_CP 'sudo tar czf /tmp/hs.tgz -C /var/lib/headscale db.sqlite noise_private.key'
scp root@PRIOR_CP:/tmp/hs.tgz /tmp/hs.tgz

# Push to NEW CP
scp /tmp/hs.tgz deploy@NEW_CP:/tmp/
ssh deploy@NEW_CP '
  sudo systemctl stop headscale || true
  sudo tar xzf /tmp/hs.tgz -C /var/lib/headscale
  sudo chown -R headscale:headscale /var/lib/headscale
'
```

Why the workflow comes after the state copy: `server_url`, ACL path, API URL,
and daemon env are environment-specific. Reusing the prior host's
`config.yaml` risks advertising the wrong coordination server and recreating
the exact "node registers against the wrong service" failure mode.

## What this module does NOT manage (yet)

- Headscale state (preauth keys/API key rotation) — manual via `headscale`
  CLI; config + ACL + daemon env + the public nginx vhost / LE cert / the
  `cp-<env>-router` self-enrollment are all converged by
  `arm-headscale-control-plane.yml`. The headscale public **DNS record** IS
  managed here (`cloudflare_dns_record.headscale`).
- Cloudflared tunnels — config lives at `/root/.cloudflared/` on the VM and
  is created via `cloudflared tunnel create` one-shot.
- The systemd units — installed by `deploy-eliza-provisioning-worker.yml`
  on every push.
- The actual eliza Cloud sandbox cores (data plane) — runtime autoscale.

These are tracked as follow-ups in
[`../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md#followups).

## Cost

| Component                    | Resource    | Monthly (€) |
|------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1× cpx32 (4 vCPU / 8 GB) x86 | control VM  | ~11         |
| 1× IPv4 + IPv6               | floating IP | included    |
| Cloudflare R2 state          | < 100 KB    | 0           |
| **Total per environment**    |             | **~11**     |

The default is `cpx32` since Hetzner retired `cpx21` in `fsn1`. Production VM
`eliza-production-1` runs x86 `cpx32`, the same type as staging. Moving the
control plane to ARM (`cax`-series, ~€7/mo) is a possible future cost
optimization, not current state — it needs the cloud-init arm64 templating fix
tracked as a followup first.

A 2nd control-plane VM (HA, currently unused) doubles the line. The
**data-plane autoscale** cost is separate and elastic.
