"""Fail closed when an SBY proof lacks conclusive engine-level PASS evidence.

SymbiYosys reports a task as ``DONE (PASS)`` as soon as *any* configured
engine returns ``pass`` — even if a second engine errored, timed out, or was
terminated without a conclusive result. Single-engine tasks can also leave a
stale or partial workdir behind if the overall SBY status is trusted without
checking the per-engine summary lines.

This gate re-reads the per-task SBY ``logfile.txt`` and requires that, for any
task whose overall result is PASS, *every* configured engine also returned
``pass``. An engine that errored, timed out, or was terminated mid-solve is
treated as failed evidence. A genuine PASS is accepted only when the overall
task and all configured engines agree.

Usage::

    python3 verify/check_formal_engine_agreement.py <sby-logfile-or-workdir> ...

Each argument is either an SBY ``logfile.txt`` or a workdir containing one.
With no arguments the canonical evidence logs under ``verify/formal/*/`` are
checked. Exit code 0 = all engines agree; 1 = disagreement; 2 = bad input.
