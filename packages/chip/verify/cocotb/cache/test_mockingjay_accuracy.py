"""Mockingjay-vs-LRU accuracy benchmark on a synthetic stream.

The cocotb DUT (`e1_mockingjay_prod`) exposes a `victim_way` query
output plus access-update inputs. The harness:

1. Reproduces the Mockingjay-style set's victim choice from the DUT via
   the `query_set` output and feeds back the actual hit/miss decision.
2. Runs the same stream through a pure-Python LRU model.
3. Compares hit-rate.

Stream pattern: "scan + reuse" — a small hot working set (HOT_SET) that
fits in the per-set associativity, interleaved with a large scan that
strides through many cold sets. Classical LRU evicts the hot set on
every scan pass; Mockingjay should learn (via the STT-fed RTP) that the
hot-set PCs are short-reuse and keep them.

The stream is split into two windows. The first ``WARMUP_OPS`` ops are
not counted toward the pass/fail comparison; they exist to warm the
Mockingjay STT and PC-keyed RTP so that ETR insertion has a learned
signal during the measurement window. Without warmup, every line
carries ``MAX_ETR`` at reset and the policy collapses to whatever the
tie-break randomizer picks — that is correct behaviour but it is not
the regime the policy is designed for. The LRU oracle is measured on
the same windowing so the comparison is apples-to-apples.

Pass criterion: Mockingjay hit-rate is at least +10% (absolute or
relative) above LRU on this synthetic stream in the measurement
window. Phone-class IPC remains BLOCKED — see
docs/evidence/cache/cache-evidence-gate.yaml.
