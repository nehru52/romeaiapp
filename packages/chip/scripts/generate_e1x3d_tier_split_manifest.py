"""Emit the E1X3D 2-tier pseudo-3D split manifest.

Describes the Shrunk-2D / Compact-2D-style partition of one E1X3D processing
element into two tiers bonded face-to-face:

  * a **logic tier** -- the tiny RV64 PE datapath, signed off as the open-PDK
    Sky130 ``e1x3d_tile`` OpenLane run; and
  * a **memory (SRAM) tier** -- the folded local-SRAM, signed off as the
    existing Sky130 hard-SRAM macro-array run ``e1_npu_weight_buffer_array``.

The per-tier area / footprint and the inter-tier interface come straight from
``compiler.runtime.e1x3d_placement_model.build_placement_report`` (the
``block_sram_on_logic`` split): the binding XY constraint is the per-tier SRAM
area, so moving the SRAM off the logic plane shrinks the per-PE footprint while
the SRAM-port signals set the required inter-tier via density. The manifest
picks the recommended catalog bonding (face-to-face hybrid bond, or MIV for a
finer fold) and records its via-density capacity vs. the requirement.

Per-tier open-PDK signoff is referenced by inspecting the actual OpenLane run
directory on disk and reporting only the stages that produced artifacts, so the
manifest never claims a closure that is not present. A tier whose run did not
reach physical implementation (or whose memory-tier macro-array run is absent)
is recorded as ``pending`` with the missing dependency -- the fail-closed law.

True 3D DRC/LVS across the bonded interface is commercial-only and is left to
the gate (``check_e1x3d_3d_split.py``) as a documented BLOCKED escalation.

Architecture-simulation + open-PDK evidence only: not a placed 3D layout, not
3D DRC/LVS, not electrothermal/SI-PI signoff, not silicon.
