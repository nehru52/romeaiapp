"""Cross-domain microarchitectural purge-sequence model (lane 04 section 6).

Models the ordered cd_state_purge sequence the future cd_purge_seq.sv (BLOCKED)
fans out on every confidential-domain boundary crossing. The hardware invariant
(proven later by SVA, BLOCKED on Verilator/formal) is: no boundary crossing
completes while any purge step is unacked, and the steps run in dependency
order. This pure-software model lets the order + completeness be tested now.
