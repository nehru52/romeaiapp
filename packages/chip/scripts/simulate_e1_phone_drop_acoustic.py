E1 phone drop + acoustic physics simulation (analytical, reproducible).

Retires the residual "lab acoustic + drop test" item to a verified-confident
SIMULATION level. No physical drop tower / anechoic chamber / B&K mic is used;
this is a defensible analytical-physics model that states exactly what a real
lab would later confirm.

evidence_class: physics_simulation_not_lab_measured

PART A - DROP (analytical impact mechanics)
  1.0 m free fall -> v = sqrt(2 g h). The impact is modeled as a Hertzian /
  spring-damper contact between the rigid floor and the phone. From the contact
  stiffness and the device mass we get an effective natural frequency, contact
  time (half-period of the contact oscillator), peak deceleration (G), peak
  contact force, and the kinetic energy that must be absorbed. Per orientation
  (6 faces, 4 corners, edges) the contact stiffness and the load-bearing area
  change, so corner drops (small area, stiff local contact) are the worst case.
  Stresses are then checked against material strengths with a safety factor:
    - cover glass (0.7 mm chemically strengthened, flexural ~600-700 MPa)
    - PC+ABS enclosure corner (impact-modified, notched Izod ~600 J/m)
    - display bond (acrylic PSA shear)
    - screw-boss mounts (PC+ABS shear-out)

PART B - ACOUSTIC (lumped-element Thiele-Small + Helmholtz)
  - Bottom 1115 micro-speaker in its ~0.515 cc rear chamber: sealed-box
    Thiele-Small model -> system resonance fc, low-frequency rolloff, and
    SPL @1 W/10 cm vs the 90-92 dB target.
  - Earpiece 1206 receiver: SPL at the ear reference plane.
  - Helmholtz resonance of the grille slots + rear chamber: must stay out of
    the voiceband.
  - MEMS mic: datasheet SNR, sound-tunnel HF rolloff (acoustic-mass low-pass),
    and acoustic overload point (AOP).
  - Acoustic leak: gasket-compression-set seal leak vs sealed low-frequency SPL.
