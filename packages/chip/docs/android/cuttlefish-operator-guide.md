# Cuttlefish riscv64 Operator Guide

This guide drives the launch + boot validation harness for the Cuttlefish
riscv64 virtual device produced by Task 28's AOSP build pipeline. Three
scripts under `sw/aosp-device/` work together:

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `launch-cuttlefish-riscv64.sh` | host preflight, optional cleanup, `launch_cvd` with deterministic flags, wait-for-boot polling |
| `cuttlefish-boot-gate.sh` | post-launch assertions; emits `docs/evidence/android/cuttlefish_riscv64_boot.log` |
| `bootloop-triage.sh` | dumps host + guest signals to `out/triage/cuttlefish-riscv64-bootfail-<epoch>.log` when boot fails |

The capture wrapper `sw/aosp-device/capture-aosp-evidence.sh /path/to/aosp
cuttlefish-boot-full` chains launch + gate in a single command and wraps the
result with the canonical `eliza-evidence:` framing.

## Claim boundary

This stage produces *virtual-device boot smoke* evidence only. A passing
`cuttlefish_riscv64_boot.log` is not e1_soc/AP silicon evidence and is not an
Android compatibility claim. The transcript carries the existing
`claim_boundary=virtual_device_smoke_only_not_boot_or_compatibility_evidence`
marker that the broader gate enforces.

## Host prerequisites

Linux x86_64 host with hardware virtualization. The launch script will
abort with an actionable error if any of these are not satisfied:

- `/dev/kvm` readable and writable by `$USER`
- `vhost_vsock` kernel module loaded (`sudo modprobe vhost_vsock`)
- `$USER` in groups `kvm`, `cvdnetwork`, `render`
  (`sudo usermod -aG kvm,cvdnetwork,render "$USER"` then re-login)
- `qemu-system-riscv64 --version` reports >= 9.2. Cuttlefish riscv64 on
  x86_64 runs the guest CPU under QEMU TCG (KVM cannot accelerate a
  riscv64 guest on an x86_64 host); QEMU < 9.2 makes boot prohibitively
  slow.

A built AOSP tree from Task 28 is also required so that `adb`, `launch_cvd`,
`stop_cvd`, and `cvd` are on `PATH`. Source `build/envsetup.sh` and `lunch`
the riscv64 product before running the launch script, or pass
`--aosp=/path/to/aosp` so the launcher does it for you.

## One-shot launch recipe

```sh
REPO=/path/to/Eliza-AI-SoC
AOSP=/path/to/aosp

# 1. Source the AOSP environment.
cd "$AOSP"
source build/envsetup.sh
lunch aosp_cf_riscv64_phone-trunk_staging-userdebug

# 2. Launch with a clean runtime directory, shell-first GPU mode.
"$REPO/sw/aosp-device/launch-cuttlefish-riscv64.sh" \
  --clean \
  --cpus=8 \
  --memory-mb=12288 \
  --gpu-mode=none \
  --boot-timeout-seconds=1800

# 3. Run the boot gate. Record the AOSP manifest snapshot from Task 28 so
#    the transcript carries its sha256.
"$REPO/sw/aosp-device/cuttlefish-boot-gate.sh" \
  --manifest="$AOSP/eliza-cf-manifest.xml"

# 4. Stop the CVD when you're done.
stop_cvd
```

A successful run writes `docs/evidence/android/cuttlefish_riscv64_boot.log`
with `eliza-evidence: status=PASS`, `RESULT=0`, and the canonical boot
markers (`ro.product.cpu.abi=riscv64`, `uname_m=riscv64`,
`sys.boot_completed=1`, `getenforce=Enforcing`, `KERNEL_INIT_MARKER=present`,
`KERNEL_PANIC=false`, plus `BUILD_ID` and `MANIFEST_SHA256`).

Use `--gpu-mode=guest_swiftshader` once shell-first is reliable; it enables
home-screen SurfaceFlinger but is slower.

## Capture-wrapper recipe

For evidence runs use the wrapper. It applies the same eliza-evidence
framing as every other AOSP capture stage:

```sh
"$REPO/sw/aosp-device/capture-aosp-evidence.sh" "$AOSP" cuttlefish-boot-full
```

Environment knobs honored by `cuttlefish-boot-full`:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AOSP_CUTTLEFISH_BOOT_CPUS` | 8 | vCPU count |
| `AOSP_CUTTLEFISH_BOOT_MEMORY_MB` | 12288 | guest RAM (MiB) |
| `AOSP_CUTTLEFISH_BOOT_GPU_MODE` | `none` | `--gpu_mode` for `launch_cvd` |
| `AOSP_CUTTLEFISH_BOOT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | 1800 | wait-for-boot deadline |
| `AOSP_CUTTLEFISH_BOOT_MANIFEST` | empty | optional AOSP manifest xml whose sha256 is recorded |
| `AOSP_CUTTLEFISH_BOOT_CLEAN` | 0 | set to `1` to wipe `~/cuttlefish_runtime` and kill stale crosvm before launch |
| `AOSP_ADB_SERIAL` | empty | adb -s <serial> for multi-device hosts |

## Triage recipes

### Symptom: `launch_cvd` exits immediately or `adb get-state` never sees the device

Run:

```sh
"$REPO/sw/aosp-device/bootloop-triage.sh"
```

The dump contains:

- host groups (`kvm`/`cvdnetwork`/`render`)
- loaded kernel modules (`vhost_vsock`, `nbd`)
- `qemu-system-riscv64 --version`
- `ls -l /dev/kvm`
- live `crosvm` processes
- tail of `~/cuttlefish_runtime/launcher.log`
- tail of `~/cuttlefish_runtime/kernel.log`
- `adb devices -l`

### Symptom: crosvm exits with `SIGSEGV`

Known issue
[`google/android-cuttlefish#163`](https://github.com/google/android-cuttlefish/issues/163).
Force shell-first launch with `--gpu_mode=none` (the default for
`launch-cuttlefish-riscv64.sh`). Only move to `guest_swiftshader` once
shell-first is verified.

### Symptom: `Disk has been locked` from `launch_cvd`

Known issue
[`google/android-cuttlefish#146`](https://github.com/google/android-cuttlefish/issues/146).
Re-launch with `--clean`, which runs
`stop_cvd; pkill -f crosvm; rm -rf ~/cuttlefish_runtime` before
`launch_cvd`.

### Symptom: `vhost_vsock` not loaded

```sh
sudo modprobe vhost_vsock
echo vhost_vsock | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/vhost_vsock.conf
```

### Symptom: user not in `kvm`/`cvdnetwork`/`render`

```sh
sudo usermod -aG kvm,cvdnetwork,render "$USER"
# Log out and back in so group membership applies.
```

### Symptom: `qemu-system-riscv64` is < 9.2

Distribution packages may be too old. Use a recent QEMU build (Debian
testing/unstable, Ubuntu 24.04+, or build from source). Cuttlefish riscv64
boot times collapse to ~10-30 min on a 32-core host with QEMU 9.2+; the
2023 baseline (~12 h) is no longer representative.

### Symptom: `sys.boot_completed` never reaches `1`

```sh
adb shell logcat -d -b all | tail -200
adb shell dmesg | tail -200
cat ~/cuttlefish_runtime/kernel.log | tail -200
```

Then run `bootloop-triage.sh` to capture the full failure snapshot.

## Feeding boot evidence into the completion gate

The completion gate consumes `cuttlefish_riscv64_boot.log` as required
Android evidence (alongside the other `eliza_ai_soc_*` logs and the
`cuttlefish_riscv64_smoke.log`):

```sh
python3 "$REPO/scripts/check_aosp_simulator_completion_gate.py"
```

The checker BLOCKS while the boot transcript is missing. It passes the
boot-log checks once the transcript carries `RESULT=0`, the
`eliza-evidence: status=PASS` marker, and the canonical
`virtual_device_smoke_only_not_boot_or_compatibility_evidence` boundary
marker - exactly what `cuttlefish-boot-gate.sh` writes on a clean run.

A FAIL transcript stays archived. The checker continues to BLOCK on it,
which is the desired behavior: failed boots must be triaged and reproduced
to a passing state, not hidden.

## Runtime launcher, bridge, and peripheral evidence

After a CVD is booted and `cuttlefish-boot-gate.sh` has promoted
`docs/evidence/android/eliza_launcher_runtime_evidence.json`, collect the
remaining interactive phone-surface evidence from the same boot:

```sh
python3 "$REPO/scripts/android/capture_launcher_runtime_evidence.py" \
  --adb-serial "${AOSP_ADB_SERIAL:-}"

python3 "$REPO/scripts/android/capture_system_bridge_runtime_evidence.py" \
  --adb-serial "${AOSP_ADB_SERIAL:-}"

python3 "$REPO/scripts/android/capture_simulated_peripheral_evidence.py"
```

The launcher capture writes
`docs/evidence/android/eliza_launcher_runtime_evidence.json`, plus referenced
logcat and transcript artifacts. It blocks unless ADB proves riscv64 boot
completion, PackageManager install, HOME role/resolve, foreground Eliza
activity, a running app service process, `/api/health` HTTP 200 with
`ready=true`, and clean fatal/SELinux log scans. If a Cuttlefish ADB connector
is running but not listed in `adb devices`, pass `--adb-connect HOST:PORT`
before the serial probe.

The system-bridge capture writes
`docs/evidence/android/system_bridge_runtime_evidence.json` and blocks unless
ADB proves boot completion, the privileged bridge package is installed, the
bridge service is registered, required privapp permissions are granted, the
launcher binds the JS bridge, live system state reaches the launcher, mock
fallback markers are absent, and logcat has no fatal crash or SELinux denial
markers. It also accepts `--adb-connect HOST:PORT` for the same Cuttlefish
connector recovery path as the launcher capture.

The peripheral capture writes one log per phone surface under
`docs/evidence/android/peripherals/`. Each probe must come from ADB-backed
runtime commands after `sys.boot_completed=1` and preserve command provenance,
`RESULT=0`, and `eliza-evidence: status=PASS`; blocked or failed probe logs
remain visible to the gate until a real passing run replaces them. A device
that is merely visible in `adb devices` is not enough for phone peripheral
evidence. For a Cuttlefish ADB connector that exists before `adb devices`
lists it, run:

```sh
python3 "$REPO/scripts/android/capture_simulated_peripheral_evidence.py" \
  --adb-connect "${AOSP_ADB_CONNECT:-127.0.0.1:6520}"
```
