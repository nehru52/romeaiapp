# E1 Phone OEM Sourcing Baseline

Status: sourcing shortlist, not a purchase order or fabrication release.
Date: 2026-05-20.

Public listing revalidation on 2026-05-20 found the current Chenghao
CH550FH01A-CT Made-in-China display listing, META/Alibaba 055WU01-class
display listing, Sincere First Made-in-China OV13855/OV13850 and GC5035 camera
module listings, Quectel RG255C vendor page, and Murata Type 2EA vendor page
still publicly visible. This is useful sourcing evidence only; it does not
replace supplier quotes, 2D drawings, FPC pinouts, STEP files, sample receipt,
or AVL approval.

## Mechanical Anchor

Use a commodity 5.5 inch FHD MIPI display module as the first enclosure and
board-size anchor. This is a deliberate manufacturability trade: a 5.5 inch
1080 x 1920 LCM is older than current flagship phone panels, but it is widely
listed by OEM display vendors and has enough public dimensional consistency to
drive a first PCB/enclosure pass.

Target geometry:

- Active area: 68.04 x 120.96 mm.
- TFT outline target: about 70-71 x 129 mm.
- Touch/lens assembly target: about 77 x 152 x 3.4 mm.
- Device envelope target: 78.0 x 153.6 x 11.8 mm flush-back before final cover-glass and
  gasket tolerance stack. This contains the 77.1 x 151.77 x 3.39 mm
  Chenghao-class CTP outline with first-pass assembly clearance.
- Rigid PCB bounding box target: 64 x 132 mm, with battery window.

The board is intentionally narrower than the display active area so the rigid
PCB can sit behind the LCM while leaving room for side-key flex, adhesive,
antenna plastic, and enclosure rails.

## Display Candidates

| Priority | Candidate | Evidence | Design Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary | 5.5 inch 1080 x 1920 MIPI 40-pin LCD/CTP, 055WU01 class | Alibaba listing advertises MIPI 4-lane, 40-pin signal interface, 1000 nit typical brightness, and 68.04 x 120.96 mm active area. | Use 4-lane DSI connector footprint and panel-bias rails; require exact FPC pinout before schematic freeze. |
| Primary alternate | Chenghao CH550FH01A-CT | Made-in-China listing shows 5.5 inch IPS TFT+CTP, 1080 x 1920, MIPI, 77.1 x 151.77 x 3.39 mm outline, 70.78 x 129.17 x 1.7 mm TFT outline, 68.04 x 120.96 mm active area. | Best current mechanical anchor because it publishes CTP and TFT outlines. |
| High-brightness alternate | 5.5 inch 1080 x 1920 MIPI 40-pin ILI7807D class | Alibaba listing advertises MIPI 40-pin, ILI7807D driver, capacitive touch, and 1200 nit brightness. | Useful outdoor-readable option; do not use for mechanical closure until outline/FPC drawing is received. |
| Lower-z alternate | 5.5 inch AMOLED 1080 x 1920 RM67191 class | Made-in-China listing shows MIPI 4 lanes, active area 68.299 x 121.421 mm, outline 70.66 x 128.36 x 0.82 mm. | Better z-height and power potential, higher sourcing and driver risk. |

Required before schematic freeze:

- Vendor drawing with FPC exit direction, connector pitch, stiffener, bend
  radius, and cover-glass stack.
- Full pinout for DSI, touch I2C, reset, TE, backlight or AMOLED power rails,
  ESD, grounds, and no-connects.
- Panel init command sequence and Linux DRM panel-driver plan.
- Backlight LED string voltage/current or AMOLED bias requirements.
- Sample quote for at least 10 units and one alternate supplier with matching
  electrical pinout.

Current public-source validation:

- Chenghao CH550FH01A-CT remains the strongest mechanical anchor because the
  listing exposes the complete CTP/TFT/active-area outline: 77.1 x 151.77 x
  3.39 mm module, 70.78 x 129.17 x 1.7 mm TFT, and 68.04 x 120.96 mm active
  area. Keep the 78.0 x 153.6 mm enclosure target until a signed drawing says
  otherwise.
- META/Alibaba 055WU01-class remains a useful 40-pin MIPI electrical alternate,
  but it cannot drive enclosure geometry until public or supplier-returned
  outline and FPC-exit dimensions are captured.
- The AMOLED RM67191-class alternate remains valuable for z-height exploration,
  but touch stack, bias sequencing, and driver risk are higher than the LCD/CTP
  anchor.

## Camera Candidates

| Position | Candidate | Evidence | Design Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rear | OV13855/OV13850 13 MP autofocus MIPI CSI module | Made-in-China Sincere First listing shows OV13855, 13 MP, autofocus, 1/3.06 inch sensor, F/2.0, 78.4 degree view angle, MIPI, 24-pin module, 10kk/month stated capacity. | Reserve 24-30 pin camera FPC, 2-4 CSI lanes, AF VCM supply, reset, clock, and privacy/flash policy. |
| Rear alternate | AR1335 13 MP AF 4-lane MIPI module | Made-in-China listing advertises AR1335, 4208 x 3120 effective pixels, 4-lane MIPI CSI-2, autofocus. | Similar routing budget; use only if driver and lens stack are better documented. |
| Front | GC5035 5 MP fixed-focus MIPI CSI module | Made-in-China listing advertises GC5035, 2592 x 1944, 2-lane MIPI, fixed focus, and 30-pin pinout. | Front-camera baseline; still needs exact z-height, FPC exit, and driver/calibration path. |
| Front/lab alternate | IMX219 8 MP fixed-focus MIPI CSI module | Alibaba listing advertises IMX219, 3280 x 2464, MIPI CSI, 25 x 24 mm module, fixed focus. | Useful for lab bring-up or front-camera alternate if mechanical size is acceptable. |

Required before schematic freeze:

- Exact FPC pinout, connector pitch, module dimensions, lens z-height, and FOV.
- CSI lane count and lane order.
- Power rail sequencing and clock requirements.
- V4L2 subdevice or Android Camera HAL path, including OTP/calibration data.

Current public-source validation:

- Sincere First OV13855/OV13850 remains the rear-camera primary class because
  the current Made-in-China listing exposes the 13 MP MIPI autofocus family,
  sensor-size/FOV class, and low-MOQ sample path. It still needs the exact
  selected module drawing, pinout, lens z-height, and power timing before the
  KiCad connector can be frozen.
- Sincere First GC5035 remains the front-camera primary class because a current
  Made-in-China listing exposes GC5035, 2592 x 1944, MIPI, and mini fixed-focus
  camera-module positioning. Confirm the exact SF-G5035S60FY/S60AY variant,
  FPC exit, and lens stack before enclosure freeze.

## Wireless And Cellular

| Block | Primary | Fallback | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cellular | Quectel RG255C LGA or RM255C M.2 5G RedCap | Quectel RM520N-GL M.2 | RG255C/RM255C keeps first-phone power, RF, and carrier scope smaller than full eMBB 5G. RM520N-GL is easier for socketed lab validation and high-throughput testing. |
| Wi-Fi/Bluetooth | Murata Type 2EA LBEE5XV2EA-802 | Existing Murata Type 1DX | Type 2EA gives Wi-Fi 6E 2x2 MIMO + Bluetooth 5.3 in a small shielded module. Type 1DX remains lower performance but simpler Linux SDIO/UART bring-up. |
| GNSS | Cellular-module GNSS first | Discrete GNSS/LNA if desense fails | Avoid another RF subsystem until cellular and Wi-Fi antenna layout are measured. |
| NFC | Discrete NFC controller + loop antenna | Omit on EVT0 | NFC loop geometry is enclosure-dependent; keep pads but do not route into the battery window without ME signoff. |

Required before schematic freeze:

- Cellular region SKU and supported LTE/NR bands.
- Carrier/PTCRB/GCF plan and whether modular certification covers the final
  antenna implementation.
- SIM/eSIM decision and E911/GNSS policy.
- Wi-Fi/BT antenna design, coax or printed antenna decision, coexistence plan,
  and country-code handling.

Current public-source validation:

- Quectel RG255C remains the right EVT cellular anchor because the vendor page
  exposes 5G RedCap Sub-6, LTE Cat 4 fallback, USB 2.0/PCIe/UART/PCM class host
  interfaces, and Linux/Android driver statements. The board still needs a
  region SKU, band matrix, hardware design guide, SIM/eSIM reference, and RF
  certification scope.
- Murata Type 2EA LBEE5XV2EA-802 remains the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth anchor because the
  vendor page exposes in-production status, Wi-Fi 6E 2x2 MIMO, Bluetooth 5.3,
  PCIe/SDIO plus UART interfaces, 1.8 V IO, and 12.5 x 9.4 x 1.2 mm package.
  The board still needs Murata's full datasheet package, reference layout,
  firmware/license path, and antenna/coexistence signoff.

## Battery Pack Candidate

| Block | Primary | Fallback | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Battery pack | LiPol LP446487 3.85 V 4500 mAh / 17.33 Wh class with PCM, NTC, and JST SHR-03V-S-B | Made-in-China 4500 mAh LiPo supplier families, or Alibaba custom 3.85 V 4500 mAh quote pool | This is the first public, dimensioned pack class close to the 17.3 Wh target. The current CAD/KiCad concept now reserves a 64 x 87 x 4.4 mm full-width cavity, but supplier drawings, PCM tail, NTC, connector, swelling, and safety data are still required. |

Required before enclosure or schematic freeze:

- Supplier quote, samples, UN38.3 summary, MSDS, PCM protection spec, and NTC
  curve.
- Exact connector pinout and mating part, or a soldered-pack variant decision.
- Battery cavity decision: enlarge the cavity, reduce capacity, or source a
  custom narrow pack whose drawing fits the 78.0 x 153.6 x 11.8 mm flush-back enclosure.
- Charge-current and thermal-soak validation against the MAX77860 charge path
  and 43 C skin-temperature limit.

## USB-C And Side Buttons

| Block | Primary | Fallback | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| USB-C EVT0 | GCT USB4105 USB2 Type-C receptacle | Molex 221632/217804 24-pin waterproof Type-C | GCT USB4105 simplifies routing for EVT0 while still enabling charge, USB2 data, ADB/fastboot, and PD CC handling. Molex waterproof 24-pin is the production path if USB3/waterproofing is required. |
| Power / volume buttons | Panasonic EVQ-P7/P3/9P7 side-push tactile | C&K KMR2 with enclosure plunger | Panasonic side-push parts are directly aligned with phone-edge actuation. KMR2 is compact and widely distributed but needs a plunger/mechanical conversion if mounted top-actuated. |

Required before schematic freeze:

- USB-C connector exact variant, footprint, shell-stake length, port opening,
  plug overmold clearance, and enclosure capture method.
- Whether EVT0 remains USB2-only or the SoC package bonds USB3/DP lanes.
- Side-key flex vs direct-on-mainboard decision.
- Button travel stack, external actuator geometry, and wake/recovery key
  firmware mapping.
