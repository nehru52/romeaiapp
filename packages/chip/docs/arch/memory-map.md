# Memory map

All addresses are byte addresses. The e1 chip uses a single-cycle MMIO request interface. Peripheral regions implement only word-aligned accesses in the first 256 bytes of each 4 KiB control window in the current RTL. The boot ROM is a separate 64 KiB aperture. For peripheral control windows, nonzero `addr[11:8]`, unaligned accesses, and unknown regions return `0xDEAD_BEEF` at the top-level decode.

| Region | Base | Size | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Boot ROM | `0x0000_0000` | `64 KiB` | Reset/identity words |
| Peripheral control | `0x1000_0000` | `4 KiB` | ID, scratch, GPIO, timer |
| DMA | `0x1001_0000` | `4 KiB` | DMA master contract model |
| NPU | `0x1002_0000` | `4 KiB` | Small NPU datapath |
| Display | `0x1003_0000` | `4 KiB` | Framebuffer scanout controller |
| DRAM aperture | `0x8000_0000` | `4 KiB` | SRAM-backed test DRAM visible to debug MMIO and DMA |

## Linux-capable AXI-Lite scaffold map

The CPU/interconnect scaffold is separate from the e1-chip debug MMIO path. It uses AXI-Lite-style channels and establishes the future software contract. The e1-chip top now exposes a small debug-visible DRAM aperture for DMA integration, while the Linux-capable scaffold keeps its own AXI-Lite DRAM model:

| Region | Base | Size | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Interrupt controller | `0x0C00_0000` | `4 KiB` | PLIC-style source pending, enable, claim/complete scaffold |
| DMA control scaffold | `0x1001_0000` | `4 KiB` | AXI-Lite DMA control target; DMA master is arbitrated onto the DRAM model |
| NPU control scaffold | `0x1002_0000` | `4 KiB` | AXI-Lite NPU control target; descriptor-master traffic fails closed in this scaffold |
| Display control scaffold | `0x1003_0000` | `4 KiB` | AXI-Lite display control target; framebuffer scanout is not routed to production DRAM here |
| DRAM aperture | `0x8000_0000` | `256 MiB` | External DRAM controller/PHY boundary; current RTL model implements a small test memory |

Unmapped AXI-Lite scaffold accesses return `DECERR`; reads also return `0xDEAD_BEEF`.

The `256 MiB` row is the software-visible aperture contract, not modeled capacity. The current SRAM-backed RTL model under that aperture implements only `4 KiB`; accesses within `0x8000_0000` - `0x8FFF_FFFF` but outside the 4 KiB model return DRAM-model `SLVERR`, not AXI-Lite decode `DECERR`. The tiny CPU execution test uses the DRAM aperture as instruction and data memory. The current DRAM model implements aligned 32-bit words with byte strobes; the CPU subset only generates aligned `LW` and `SW`.

The Linux-capable scaffold routes DMA master traffic only to the DRAM model. DMA access attempts outside the DRAM aperture must fail with a memory error and must not update MMIO targets. NPU and display are software-visible MMIO targets in this map, but NPU descriptor-master traffic and display framebuffer reads are not production DRAM fabric evidence. This is a local containment check, not an IOMMU or coherency implementation.

The map is also not a complete boot-memory map. The current reset ROM entry is
the e1-chip identity ROM, and no boot SRAM region, ROM-to-SRAM copy contract,
DRAM initialization sequence, or OpenSBI memory-discovery handoff is implemented
in this map. Those rows must be added before Linux boot-memory readiness can be
claimed.

## Linux access-map dependencies

The scaffold map is not yet a complete Linux device memory map. Before a Linux/Android readiness claim, the memory map must explicitly reserve and test these dependencies:

| Dependency | Required map contract |
| --- | --- |
| Reset ROM | Immutable reset vector, executable ROM image or source, failure behavior, and handoff target. |
| Boot SRAM | SRAM base/size, permissions, stack/temporary storage ownership, zeroization or lifetime policy, and DMA exclusion. |
| CLINT/ACLINT | Machine timer and software interrupt window, CPU privilege access, DMA exclusion, and device-tree binding evidence. |
| PLIC/IMSIC | Interrupt-controller pending, enable, priority, threshold, claim/complete, CPU privilege access, DMA exclusion, and source-ID stability. |
| IOMMU/SMMU | MMIO aperture, stream/client IDs, page table format, fault-status registers, interrupt source, and reset behavior. |
| DRAM/LPDDR | Real target memory base, discovered size, reserved firmware/device regions, cacheability attributes, training status, and boot log evidence. |
| DMA-coherent regions | Coherent or non-coherent DMA buffer attributes, cache-maintenance requirements, and dma-buf/fence compatibility evidence. |
| QoS/performance counters | Per-master bandwidth, latency, underflow, error, and fault counters if the production fabric exposes them. |

Until those rows exist with executable evidence, CLINT/PLIC access map dependencies, page fault reporting, coherent DMA, IOMMU/SMMU, and DRAM bandwidth/latency remain blockers rather than implemented behavior.

## Register conventions

All registers are 32-bit little-endian words. Writes to reserved registers are ignored. Reads from unmapped regions return `0xDEAD_BEEF`.
