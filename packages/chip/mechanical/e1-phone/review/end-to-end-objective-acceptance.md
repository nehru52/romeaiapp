# E1 Phone End-To-End Objective Acceptance

Status: blocked_not_end_to_end_ready.

This gate joins board objective readiness with mechanical release gates for the complete phone.

## Board Objectives

- BLOCKED: `popular_screen_size_fit`
- BLOCKED: `screen_camera_oem_sourcing`
- BLOCKED: `usb_c_power_volume_hardware`
- BLOCKED: `off_the_shelf_wireless_modules`
- BLOCKED: `board_size_power_rf_thermal_optimization`
- BLOCKED: `supplier_footprints_pinouts_and_3d_models`
- BLOCKED: `schematic_and_pcb_routed_release`
- BLOCKED: `component_height_and_enclosure_step`
- BLOCKED: `manufacturing_and_factory_release`

## Mechanical Gates

- BLOCKED: `routed_board_step_and_clearance`
- BLOCKED: `supplier_family_lock`
- BLOCKED: `full_cad_boolean_interference`
- BLOCKED: `automated_visual_and_manual_cmf_signoff`
- BLOCKED: `physical_process_validation_results`
- BLOCKED: `tooling_mold_flow_and_toolmaker_signoff`
- BLOCKED: `orange_cmf_release`
- BLOCKED: `manufacturing_release_readiness`

## Release Rule

- Every board objective requirement and every mechanical gate must pass, the board end-to-end release decision must be true, manufacturing_release_ready must be true, and all required release outputs must exist before claiming the finished phone is end-to-end ready.
