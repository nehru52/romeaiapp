# E1 Phone Assemblability Verification

Evidence class: `cad_assemblability_check_for_evt_planning` | Revision: `evt0-mechanical-cad-flush-back` | Date: 2026-05-21

Engine: OCP.BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape + BRepAlgoAPI_Common (swept insertion). Each part is swept from a 8.0 mm back-off along its insertion axis through 8 steps into final pose; B-rep min-gap / intersection vs already-placed parts at every step. Intentional final-seat mating contacts are excluded.

## Verdict: DEVICE IS ASSEMBLABLE

- Parts in manifest: 258
- Parts loaded (B-rep): 258
- Parts placed across 20 assembly steps: 99
- Trapped parts (no collision-free path): 0 
- Fastener access (10 bosses + 8 snaps): PASS
- FPC routing (no pinch): PASS

## FPC Routing

| Flex | Bend keepout | Connector | Unpinched | Min clearance (mm) | Pinching parts |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| display FPC | display_fpc_bend_keepout | display_fpc_connector | yes | 0.11 | - |
| battery/PMIC interconnect (side service loop) | split_interconnect_side_flex | split_interconnect_top_connector | yes | 0.56 | - |
| split top flex tail | split_interconnect_top_flex_tail | split_interconnect_top_connector | yes | 0.25 | - |
| split bottom flex tail | split_interconnect_bottom_flex_tail | split_interconnect_bottom_connector | yes | 0.25 | - |

All parts have a collision-free insertion path in the stated back-shell-up order; all fasteners are tool-accessible and all modeled FPC bend keepouts are unpinched. No trapped parts. The redesigned flush-back e1-phone is assemblable as sequenced.
