## Supporting Cases

- Part review: PASS (258 parts).
- Part-to-view coverage: PASS (258/258 parts).
- Visual decisions: PASS (7 decisions, 5 open manual review items).

## Release Rule

- Every required full-object, detail, exploded, component, tooling, and per-part review artifact must be generated, pass pixel/contact-sheet checks, every CAD part must map to at least one generated review view plus the per-part top-view and exploded-context contact sheets, and the views must be covered by a recorded CAD visual/design decision before automated visual coverage is accepted. Production visual/CMF signoff remains blocked until manual review items are closed.
