"""E1X3D 3D-placement feasibility model.

Models the "small in XY, tall in Z" tier-partitioning of a single E1X3D
processing element: a logic tier with its local SRAM folded onto one or more
memory tiers above it (memory-on-logic). It quantifies the three quantities the
research says decide 3D feasibility:

1. **XY footprint shrink** from moving SRAM off the logic plane (and folding it
   across memory tiers). The binding XY constraint is the per-tier SRAM area, so
   more memory tiers shrink the footprint further at the cost of a taller stack.
2. **Inter-tier via density** of the tier split, checked against a catalog of
   bonding technologies. This is where the research finding "production hybrid
   bonding (~6 um) is too coarse to bisect a small PE" becomes a checkable gate:
   a coarse block split fits hybrid bonding, but a fine logic fold needs
   monolithic-3D (MIV) density.
3. **Wirelength delta** vs the planar baseline (Open3DBench two-tier ~ -24%).

This is an analytic placement-feasibility model, not a placed layout. The real
prototype path is OpenROAD-Research / Open3DBench / Pin-3D with DREAMPlace and
HotSpot/3D-ICE (open, runnable); the real signoff path (3D DRC/LVS,
electrothermal, SI/PI) is commercial-only and fails closed as a documented
BLOCKED escalation.

# Catalog of inter-tier bonding technologies:

#
# The GEOMETRIC capacity at a pitch is (1000/pitch_um)^2 vias/mm2, capped at the
# technology's demonstrated density ceiling (MIV ~30M/mm2 per the research). That
# is the theoretical packing of bond pads and OVERSTATES what a real flow can
# route as inter-tier signals: keep-out, redundancy, power/ground bonds, and
# alignment tolerance all consume budget.
#
# Feasibility is therefore gated on the REALIZABLE signal density, not the
# geometric one. The anchor is TSMC's published F2F SoIC figure of ~14,000
# signals/mm2 at 6 um HVM (vs the 27,778/mm2 geometric value) -- a bonding
# efficiency of ~0.5. Finer hybrid pitches scale by the same quadratic with the
# same efficiency factor; 1 um hybrid is research-track for general logic
# (imec W2W 1 um is HVM for image sensors / 3D NAND only), so its realizable
# figure is a research extrapolation, not 2025 HVM. Monolithic MIV is sequential
# integration with near-unity efficiency at its demonstrated ~100k MIV/mm2.
