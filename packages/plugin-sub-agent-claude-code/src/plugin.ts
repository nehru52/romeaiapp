/**
 * @elizaos/plugin-sub-agent-claude-code
 *
 * Reference remote-mode sub-agent plugin. Shipped as a workspace
 * package so the agent's `installRemotePlugin(plugin, { source: {
 * kind: "workspace", pkgName: "@elizaos/plugin-sub-agent-claude-code"
 * } })` can drop it in without writing any worker source on the fly.
 *
 * The agent typically constructs the Plugin object like:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { plugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-sub-agent-claude-code";
 * await runtime.installRemotePlugin(plugin, {
 *   source: { kind: "workspace", pkgName: "@elizaos/plugin-sub-agent-claude-code" },
 *   lifetime: "session",
 * });
 * await runtime.getService("sub-agent.claude-code").createSession({
 *   cwd: "/path/to/project",
 *   initialPrompt: "list files in src/",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The plugin opts into `role: "sub-agent"` and `isolation: "isolated-process"`
 * so the host's AdaptiveWorkerRunner spawns it via Bun.spawn rather than as
 * a Worker. That guarantees a crash in the Claude Code CLI doesn't bring
 * down the agent process.

// We intentionally use loose typing for the Plugin shape rather than
// pulling in @elizaos/core (which would force a heavyweight dep tree
// onto every sub-agent runner). The runtime materialises this through
// the worker-runtime descriptor builder, which validates structurally.
