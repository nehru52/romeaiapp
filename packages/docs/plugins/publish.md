This guide covers the full publishing workflow for a Eliza plugin — from packaging to npm publication and community registry submission.

## Naming Conventions

Choose a package name that follows the established convention:

| Scope | Pattern | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Official elizaOS | `@elizaos/plugin-{name}` | `@elizaos/plugin-openai` |
| Community (scoped) | `@yourorg/plugin-{name}` | `@acme/plugin-analytics` |
| Community (unscoped) | `elizaos-plugin-{name}` | `elizaos-plugin-weather` |

The runtime recognizes all three patterns for auto-discovery.

## package.json Requirements

Your plugin's `package.json` must include these fields:

```json
{
  "name": "@elizaos/plugin-my-feature",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "One-line description of what this plugin does",
  "type": "module",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
  "files": ["dist", "elizaos.plugin.json"],
  "keywords": ["elizaos", "eliza", "plugin"],
  "license": "MIT",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/yourorg/plugin-my-feature"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@elizaos/core": ">=2.0.0-alpha"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@elizaos/core": "alpha",
    "typescript": "^5.0.0"
  }
}
```

**Key points:**
- Declare `@elizaos/core` as a `peerDependency` — not a direct dependency — to avoid version conflicts.
- Include `elizaos.plugin.json` in `files` so the manifest is published alongside the code.
- Use `"type": "module"` for ESM output.

## Build Configuration

Use TypeScript targeting ESM:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
    "outDir": "dist",
    "declaration": true,
    "declarationMap": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  },
  "include": ["src"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist", "**/*.test.ts"]
}
```

## Versioning

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

| Change | Bump |
|--------|------|
| New action, provider, or feature (backward compatible) | Minor (`1.0.0` → `1.1.0`) |
| Bug fixes only | Patch (`1.0.0` → `1.0.1`) |
| Breaking API change | Major (`1.0.0` → `2.0.0`) |

For plugins targeting the elizaOS `next` release line, use prerelease versions:

```bash
npm version prerelease --preid=next
# 1.0.0 → 1.0.1-next.0
```

## Publishing to npm

### 1. Authenticate

```bash
npm login
```

### 2. Build

```bash
bun run build
```

Verify the `dist/` directory contains the compiled output before publishing.

### 3. Dry Run

Always preview what will be published:

```bash
npm publish --dry-run --access public
```

Check that the output includes only `dist/`, `elizaos.plugin.json`, `package.json`, and `README.md`.

### 4. Publish

```bash
npm publish --access public
```

For prerelease versions targeting the elizaOS `next` release line:

```bash
npm publish --access public --tag next
```

### 5. Verify

```bash
npm info @yourorg/plugin-my-feature
```

## Plugin Manifest

Include an `elizaos.plugin.json` at the package root for rich UI integration in the Eliza admin panel:

```json
{
  "id": "my-feature",
  "name": "My Feature Plugin",
  "description": "Does something useful",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "kind": "skill",

  "requiredSecrets": ["MY_FEATURE_API_KEY"],
  "optionalSecrets": ["MY_FEATURE_DEBUG"],

  "configSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "apiKey": { "type": "string" },
      "endpoint": { "type": "string", "format": "uri" }
    },
    "required": ["apiKey"]
  },

  "uiHints": {
    "apiKey": {
      "label": "API Key",
      "type": "password",
      "sensitive": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

**Documentation:**
- Include a `README.md` with installation instructions, required environment variables, and usage examples.
- Document every action with a description of when the LLM will invoke it.
- List all required and optional env vars in a table.

**Security:**
- Never log API keys or secrets — use `runtime.logger` carefully.
- Validate and sanitize all parameters in action handlers.
- Use `peerDependencies` for `@elizaos/core` to prevent duplicate installations.

**Compatibility:**
- Test against the current `next` release of `@elizaos/core`.
- Declare your `peerDependencies` version range conservatively: `"@elizaos/core": ">=2.0.0-alpha"`.
- Export a `Plugin` type-compatible default export — do not use default exports for other purposes.

**Quality:**
- Include unit tests with at least 80% coverage. (Note: this is the recommended bar for standalone published plugins. The monorepo enforces a 25% lines/functions/statements, 15% branches floor from `scripts/coverage-policy.mjs`.)
- Run `tsc --noEmit` in CI to catch type errors.
- Test the published package with `npm pack` before publishing.

## Multi-Language Plugins

Plugins can include implementations in multiple languages:

```
my-plugin/
├── typescript/     # Primary TypeScript implementation
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── tsconfig.json
├── python/         # Optional Python SDK bindings
│   ├── src/
│   └── pyproject.toml
├── rust/           # Optional Rust native module
│   ├── src/
│   └── Cargo.toml
└── elizaos.plugin.json
```

The TypeScript implementation is always required. Python and Rust implementations are optional and used by their respective SDKs. The `elizaos.plugin.json` manifest at the root describes the plugin for all languages.

## Community Registry

The public plugin registry is served at [`plugins.elizacloud.ai`](https://plugins.elizacloud.ai). The runtime discovers community plugins by fetching `https://plugins.elizacloud.ai/generated-registry.json` (falling back to `index.json`), and recognizes any npm package whose `keywords` include `elizaos` as a plugin.

The community registry source of truth lives in the monorepo at [`packages/registry`](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/main/packages/registry). It replaced the archived, read-only `elizaos-plugins/registry` repository the old docs pointed at — see [elizaOS/eliza#8173](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/8173).

After publishing to npm (the `@elizaos/*` scope is reserved — use your own scope or an unscoped `elizaos-plugin-*` name) and making your GitHub repository public, generate the entry metadata:

```bash
elizaos plugins submit . --dry-run
```

Add the printed `entries/third-party/<package>.json` file under `packages/registry/entries/third-party/`, then validate, regenerate, and open a pull request:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/registry validate
bun run --cwd packages/registry generate
```

The full walkthrough — with a worked example ([`packages/examples/plugin-echo`](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/main/packages/examples/plugin-echo)) — is in the [registry package README](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/main/packages/registry#adding-a-third-party-plugin).

Before requesting a listing, make sure your package:

1. Is published to npm (the `@elizaos/*` scope is reserved — use your own scope)
2. Includes the `elizaos` keyword in `package.json` (this is what the runtime uses to auto-recognize it as a plugin)
3. Ships a valid `elizaos.plugin.json` manifest
4. Has a public GitHub repository
5. Includes a README with setup instructions and required environment variables

Community plugins are reviewed for security, functionality, and documentation quality before listing. npm keyword discovery works without a registry entry; the registry adds metadata and curation. See the [Plugin Registry Guide](/guides/registry) for details.
