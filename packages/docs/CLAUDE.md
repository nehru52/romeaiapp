# @elizaos/docs

Mintlify-hosted documentation for the elizaOS project — covers the OS, runtime, app layer, Cloud, Chip, and Robot tracks.

## Purpose / role

This package is a static documentation site, not a library. It has no exports and is not imported by any other package. It is consumed by the Mintlify platform, which serves it at the elizaOS public docs URL. The `private: true` flag in `package.json` enforces that it is never published to npm.

## Commands

All scripts are in `packages/docs/package.json`.

```bash
# Run the test suite (nav integrity, page existence, broken links, empty files)
bun run --cwd packages/docs test

# Preview locally (install Mintlify CLI first: bun install -g mint)
# predev auto-syncs brand assets from packages/shared
mint dev     # run inside packages/docs; starts at http://localhost:3000

# Build (prebuild auto-syncs brand assets; actual build is handled by Mintlify CI)
# predev / prebuild both run: node ../shared/scripts/sync-to-public.mjs ./public --logos --favicons --ogembeds --banners
```

## Test suite

`test/docs.test.js` uses Node's built-in test runner (no external framework). It validates:

- `docs.json` exists, is valid JSON, and has required Mintlify fields (`name`, `colors`, `navigation`, `theme`).
- Navigation tabs and groups have no duplicate labels.
- No page is listed twice in the same group.
- All pages referenced in `docs.json` navigation have a matching `.md` or `.mdx` file on disk.
- All markdown files are non-empty.
- All internal links in markdown/MDX files resolve to real files.

Run with `bun run --cwd packages/docs test`.

## How to add or edit documentation

1. Create a `.mdx` (preferred) or `.md` file under the appropriate directory.
2. Add the page path (without extension) to the correct group in `docs.json` under `navigation.tabs`.
3. Verify with `bun run --cwd packages/docs test` — the test catches missing files and broken links.
4. Preview locally with `mint dev` from inside `packages/docs`.

## Navigation structure (docs.json)

The `docs.json` file controls everything Mintlify renders: tabs, groups, page order, colors, fonts, logo, and navbar links. Each tab maps to a content area. Pages are listed by path relative to `packages/docs`, without extension.

Top-level tabs as of current content:
- **Get Started** — installation, quickstart, tracks overview, changelog, direction
- **OS** — elizaOS operating system (Linux, AOSP, install)
- **Runtime** — agent track, framework (@elizaos/core), plugins, runtime internals, agent internals
- **App** — app/desktop/mobile layer
- **Cloud** — Eliza Cloud managed APIs and services
- **Chip** — E1 RISC-V SoC
- **Robot** — embodiment pages (tracks/training/robot, tracks/training/feed)
- **CLI** — CLI reference (create-project, create-plugin, overview)
- **Reference** — configuration, deployment, advanced topics, security

## Brand asset sync

`predev` and `prebuild` both run `node ../shared/scripts/sync-to-public.mjs ./public` with flags `--logos --favicons --ogembeds --banners`. This copies brand assets from `packages/shared` into the `public/` directory so Mintlify can serve them. Do not hand-edit files under `public/brand/` — they are regenerated on every dev/build run.

## Conventions / gotchas

- This package has no TypeScript source. All content is `.md` / `.mdx`. Do not add a `src/` directory or TypeScript code here.
- `docs.json` navigation paths are case-sensitive and must exactly match file paths on disk.
- The test suite checks every internal link; broken links will fail CI. Always run tests after adding or renaming pages.
- The `public/brand/` directory is auto-generated by the sync script (and committed). Edit brand asset source files in `packages/shared`, not here — local edits are overwritten on the next dev/build run.
- Mintlify uses the `$schema` in `docs.json` for validation; keep the schema URL intact.
- For architecture, naming, logging, and git workflow rules that apply across the entire repo, see the root `AGENTS.md`.
