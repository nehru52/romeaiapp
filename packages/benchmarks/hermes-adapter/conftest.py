"""Pytest bootstrap for the hermes-adapter test suite.

``hermes_adapter.client`` imports ``benchmarks.lib.base_benchmark_client`` for
the shared retry / cost / telemetry scaffold. That import resolves cleanly
only when ``packages/`` (which contains the top-level ``benchmarks`` namespace
package) is on ``sys.path``. When pytest is invoked from inside this adapter
directory — or with a tight ``--rootdir`` — that ancestor isn't picked up
automatically, which surfaces as ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
'benchmarks'`` at collection time.

Surface that path here so adapter tests work the same way whether they're
run standalone or as part of the wider ``packages/benchmarks`` suite.
