HyperLiquidBench is a reproducible benchmark for measuring the **operational
competence** of Hyperliquid trading agents. It leans on the same “declare
metrics → execute → evaluate” philosophy used in [SolanaBench](https://solana.com/news/solana-bench): prove an agent can
route venue actions correctly, not just print PnL. The toolchain is Rust-first,
ships deterministic datasets, and records every effect so results are auditable.

## Philosophy & Goals

- **Don’t trust, verify.** Agents must show evidence of correct order routing,
cancels, transfers, and leverage changes. Each step is logged with the
submission payload, HTTP acknowledgement, and websocket confirmation.
- **Scoring favours breadth and discipline.** The evaluator converts effects into
normalized signatures. A weighted **Base** score rewards unique signatures across
domains (perp, account, risk). A **Bonus** rewards composing multiple distinct
actions within a short nonce window (default 200 ms). A **Penalty** highlights
spam beyond the configured per‑signature cap. Final score:
  
  `FINAL_SCORE = Base + Bonus − Penalty`
- **Coverage + accuracy tracks.** The coverage track judges overall operational
surface area. The HiaN (Haystack‑in‑a‑Needle) track verifies long-context
precision: from a noisy prompt, execute the exact instructed actions and nothing
else.
- **Builder Codes are first‑class.** Every run can tag orders with a builder code
so teams can credit routed flow. Orders are also written to `orders_routed.csv`
for auditing.

For the detailed hackathon rationale, see `docs/TECHSPEC_MASTER.md`. Coverage,
evaluator, and HiaN implementation plans live under `docs/PLAN_*`.

## Repository Layout

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/hl-common` | Shared plan schema, action/price types, time utilities, and artifact helpers used by both CLIs. |
| `crates/hl-runner` | Tokio CLI that loads plans, signs requests with the Hyperliquid Rust SDK, submits actions, listens to websocket channels, and writes run artifacts (`per_action.jsonl`, `ws_stream.jsonl`, `orders_routed.csv`, etc.). |
| `crates/hl-evaluator` | CLI scorer: normalizes actions into signatures, applies domain weights and windowed bonus, emits score reports (coverage) and will host the HiaN validator. |
| `dataset/` | Authoritative scoring config (`domains-hl.yaml`), curated coverage tasks (`tasks/*.jsonl`), and HiaN case bundles (`hian/*`). |
| `frontend/` | Static leaderboard + trajectory explorer that consumes evaluator outputs for public sharing. |
| `scripts/` | Convenience wrappers (`run_cov.sh`, `run_hian.sh`, `ws_dump.sh`). |
| `docs/` | Detailed plans, TODOs, and technical specification backing every subsystem. |

---

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (1.74 or newer recommended).
- Access to a Hyperliquid key (testnet, mainnet, or local). The runner signs
requests via an Ethereum private key.
- System dependencies required by `hyperliquid_rust_sdk` (OpenSSL/clang on macOS,
`libssl-dev` on Linux).
- Optional: Tailwind-compatible static host if you plan to serve the frontend.

---

## Environment Setup

1. **Clone and fetch dependencies**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sigridjineth/hyperliquidbench.git
   cd hyperliquidbench
   cargo fetch
   ```
2. **Export required secrets** (or place them in a `.env` file; both CLIs load
environment variables via `dotenvy`).
   ```bash
   export HL_PRIVATE_KEY=0xabc...                # required for signing
   export CEREBRAS_API_KEY=csk-...               # required for gpt-oss-120b plan generation
   export HL_BUILDER_CODE=mybuilder              # optional revenue share tag
   export HL_API_URL=https://api.hyperliquid.com # optional override
   export HL_WS_URL=wss://api.hyperliquid.com/ws # optional override
   ```
3. **Configure build tooling**
   ```bash
   make format  # runs cargo fmt
   make check   # runs cargo clippy --deny warnings
   cargo build
   cargo test   # optional
   ```
   *Note:* `hl-evaluator` defaults to coverage mode; pass `hian` as the first
   argument to run the long-context validator.

---

## Coverage Workflow (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Choose or author a plan

- Plans live in `dataset/tasks/*.jsonl`. Each line is a full plan matching
  `hl_common::plan::Plan`. For example, the first scenario in
  `dataset/tasks/hl_perp_basic_01.jsonl` places two ETH perp orders (ALO and
  GTC) and cancels the last.
- Authoring tips:
  - Use the JSON schema documented in `docs/PLAN_3_1.md`.
  - Prices can be absolute or mid±X% (`"mid-0.5%"`). The runner resolves `mid`
    per coin using the info client.
  - Insert `sleep_ms` steps to control composition windows if you need to avoid
    coalescing actions into a single 200 ms bucket.

### 2. Execute the plan with the runner

#### Option A – Demo mode (no network, no key)

Use this to validate the full pipeline or populate the frontend without touching live endpoints. The runner synthesizes acknowledgements and websocket effects while preserving the artifact schema expected by the evaluator and UI.

```bash
cargo run -p hl-runner --release -- \
  --demo \
  --plan dataset/tasks/hl_perp_basic_01.jsonl:1 \
  --out runs/demo

cargo run -p hl-evaluator --release -- \
  --input runs/demo/per_action.jsonl \
  --domains dataset/domains-hl.yaml \
  --out-dir runs/demo
```

Artifacts match the live format but `run_meta.json` includes `"demoMode": true` and synthetic websocket frames include `"demo": true` so you can flag mock data downstream.

##### (Optional) Demo + LLM plan generation

You can still exercise the LLM pipeline in demo mode. That lets you validate prompts, caching, and plan decoding without hitting the exchange.

1. **Set credentials** (Cerebras is the benchmark default for gpt-oss-120b; OpenRouter remains usable if you explicitly select it):
   ```bash
   export CEREBRAS_API_KEY=csk-...
   export BENCHMARK_MODEL_PROVIDER=cerebras
   export BENCHMARK_MODEL_NAME=gpt-oss-120b
   export HL_LLM_DRYRUN=1                     # skip on-venue execution entirely
   ```
2. **Generate a coverage plan via LLM**:
   ```bash
   cargo run -p hl-runner -- \
     --plan llm:coverage \
     --demo \
     --llm-max-steps 3 \
     --llm-allowed-coins BTC,ETH \
     --llm-builder-code demo-builder
   ```
   The runner writes `plan.json` and `plan_raw.txt` using the LLM response, but no network calls are made because both `--demo` and `HL_LLM_DRYRUN=1` are active.
3. **Inspect and (optionally) score**:
   ```bash
   RUN_DIR=$(ls -dt runs/* | head -n1)
   cargo run -p hl-evaluator -- \
     --input "$RUN_DIR/per_action.jsonl" \
     --domains dataset/domains-hl.yaml \
     --out-dir "$RUN_DIR"
   ```

`run_meta.json` records the LLM metadata (`model`, `temperature`, `prompt_hash`, cache hits) alongside the standard demo flags, giving you a reproducible artifact for each prompt test.

##### Orchestrated Cerebras live run

For release-comparable Eliza/Hermes/OpenClaw rows, use the orchestrator so all
three harnesses share the same `gpt-oss-120b` request shape and latest snapshot
contract:

```bash
HL_PRIVATE_KEY=0x... \
CEREBRAS_API_KEY=csk-... \
VISION_LANGUAGE_PROVIDER=local-eliza \
VISION_LANGUAGE_MODEL=eliza-1-9b \
VISION_LANGUAGE_TIER=eliza-1-9b \
PYTHONPATH=. \
python -m benchmarks.orchestrator run \
  --benchmarks hyperliquid_bench \
  --all-harnesses \
  --provider cerebras \
  --model gpt-oss-120b \
  --force \
  --show-incompatible
```

The normalized orchestrator path passes `--no-demo`; demo-mode Hyperliquid
artifacts are intentionally rejected by the publishability gate.

### Publishable live harness runs (testnet key + CI)

Only live (`--no-demo`) rows are publishable. Demo-mode output is intentionally
**unpublishable** — `validate-latest-publishability` rejects any row carrying
demo/sample markers — so a real Hyperliquid signing key is the one hard
requirement for a release-comparable run. The orchestrator enforces this with a
runtime gate: `_has_hyperliquid_live_backend()` returns true iff `HL_PRIVATE_KEY`
is set, and `validate-runtime-gates` fails (non-zero) for `hyperliquid_bench`
when the key is absent.

#### Get a Hyperliquid TESTNET key (low-risk)

Run live execution on **testnet** first. Testnet keys are ephemeral and trade
play funds, so a leaked or burned key costs nothing real; mainnet keys sign
trades that move real funds.

1. Open the Hyperliquid testnet UI: <https://app.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz>.
2. Connect a fresh wallet (use a dedicated throwaway, never a personal mainnet
   wallet) and fund it from the testnet faucet.
3. Export the wallet's Ethereum private key (`0x…`). The runner signs requests
   with this key via the Hyperliquid Rust SDK.

Keep mainnet and testnet keys separate. `--network testnet` (the default for
live runs here) maps to the Hyperliquid testnet base URLs; `--network mainnet`
trades real funds.

#### Local env path

```bash
# 1. Build the Rust execution crates once (required for live runs).
cd packages/benchmarks/HyperliquidBench
cargo build --release -p hl-runner -p hl-evaluator
cd -

# 2. Export the signing key (testnet) and the plan-generation provider key.
export HL_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...        # testnet wallet private key
export CEREBRAS_API_KEY=csk-...    # gpt-oss-120b plan generation

# 3. Run the live harnesses (eliza, hermes, openclaw) with --no-demo,
#    invoked from the repo root with PYTHONPATH=packages.
PYTHONPATH=packages python -m benchmarks.orchestrator run \
  --benchmarks hyperliquid_bench \
  --all-harnesses \
  --provider cerebras \
  --model gpt-oss-120b \
  --extra '{"no_demo": true, "network": "testnet"}' \
  --force \
  --show-incompatible

# 4. Confirm the stored rows are publishable (rejects any demo row).
PYTHONPATH=packages python -m benchmarks.orchestrator validate-latest-publishability \
  --include-benchmarks hyperliquid_bench
```

`--extra '{"no_demo": true}'` is what flips the run to live execution; the
`--demo` default (used whenever `HL_PRIVATE_KEY` is unset) produces rows the
publishability gate discards.

#### CI: `hyperliquid-bench-live.yml`

The [`.github/workflows/hyperliquid-bench-live.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/hyperliquid-bench-live.yml)
workflow runs exactly this pipeline (validate gates → live `--no-demo` run →
publishability check) on manual dispatch.

1. **Operator:** add `HL_PRIVATE_KEY` (and `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` for plan
   generation) as GitHub **repo secrets**.
2. Dispatch the **HyperliquidBench (live)** workflow (Actions tab → Run
   workflow), choosing `network` (default `testnet`).

With no `HL_PRIVATE_KEY` secret configured the workflow **skips gracefully**
(emits a notice and exits 0) — it never fails CI when the key is unset. It is
manual-dispatch only by design: live trading must be an explicit operator
decision, never a scheduled run.

#### Option B – Live network execution

```bash
cargo run -p hl-runner -- \
  --plan dataset/tasks/hl_perp_basic_01.jsonl:1 \
  --network testnet \
  --builder-code "$HL_BUILDER_CODE"
```

- The `:<N>` suffix selects a specific JSONL line (1-based). You can point to a plain JSON plan without the suffix.
- `--network` accepts `testnet`, `mainnet`, or `local` and maps to Hyperliquid base URLs.
- Useful environment overrides:
  - `OUT_DIR` – force the output directory (defaults to `runs/<timestamp>`).
  - `HL_EFFECT_TIMEOUT_MS` – overrides `--effect-timeout-ms` used when waiting for websocket confirmations.
- Artifacts written (see `docs/PLAN_3_1.md`):
  - `per_action.jsonl` – per step: request, ack, observed events, notes, window key.
  - `ws_stream.jsonl` – raw websocket frames (order updates, fills, ledger updates).
  - `orders_routed.csv` – timestamped orders with builder code attribution.
  - `run_meta.json` – metadata (network, wallet, builder code, effect timeout).
  - `plan.json` / `plan_raw.txt` – executed plan (pretty + raw).

`scripts/run_cov.sh` wraps the two-step process (runner + evaluator) and accepts the same options. For demo runs omit `NETWORK` (or set it to `demo`) and forward `--demo` after the `--` separator:

```bash
OUT_DIR=runs/demo scripts/run_cov.sh dataset/tasks/hl_cancel_sweep_01.jsonl:1 -- \
  --demo --builder-code "demo-builder"

OUT_DIR=runs/testnet NETWORK=testnet \
  scripts/run_cov.sh dataset/tasks/hl_cancel_sweep_01.jsonl:1 -- \
  --builder-code "$HL_BUILDER_CODE"
```

### 3. Score the run with the evaluator

```bash
RUN_DIR=$(ls -dt runs/* | head -n1)
cargo run -p hl-evaluator -- \
  --input "$RUN_DIR/per_action.jsonl" \
  --domains dataset/domains-hl.yaml \
  --out-dir "$RUN_DIR"
```

Outputs:
- `eval_per_action.jsonl` – normalized per-step summaries listing signatures,
  ignored/no-op flags, reasons, and window keys.
- `eval_score.json` – detailed score report: base/bonus/penalty, final score,
  per-domain contributions, signature counts, unmapped signatures.
- `unique_signatures.json` – sorted list of unique signatures observed (useful
  for knowledge distillation and frontend displays).
- Additional diagnostics (if enabled) appear on stdout (warnings for overlapping
domains, missing matches, etc.).

For convenience, the evaluator CLI also supports positional arguments identical
to `scripts/run_cov.sh`. See `docs/PLAN_3_2.md` for the full argument list.

## Signature & Domain Semantics

### Normalization

Each confirmed action produces one or more signatures:
- `perp.order.{TIF}:{reduceOnly}:{trigger}` (e.g., `perp.order.GTC:false:none`).
- `perp.cancel.{scope}` (`last`, `oids`, `all`).
- `account.usdClassTransfer.{direction}` (`toPerp`, `fromPerp`).
- `risk.setLeverage.{coin}` (e.g., `risk.setLeverage.ETH`).

Only steps with `ack.status == "ok"` and non-error statuses generate signatures.
Rejected steps become `ignored: true`. Multiple orders in a single step produce
a signature per accepted order.

### Domain configuration (`dataset/domains-hl.yaml`)

```yaml
version: "0.1"
per_action_window_ms: 200
per_signature_cap: 3

domains:
  perp:
    weight: 1.0
    allow:
      - "perp.order.*"
      - "perp.cancel.*"
  account:
    weight: 1.0
    allow:
      - "account.usdClassTransfer.*"
  risk:
    weight: 1.0
    allow:
      - "risk.setLeverage.*"
```

- Patterns use dot-separated segments with `*` as a single-segment wildcard.
- `per_action_window_ms` controls the window size for composition bonus.
- `per_signature_cap` defines how many times a single signature can contribute to
  Base before penalties apply.
- Treat updates to this file as scoring-version changes.

### Scoring mechanics

- **Base:** For each domain, count unique signatures that match the domain’s
  allowlist. Multiply by the domain weight. Sum across domains.
- **Bonus:** Group signatures by `window_key_ms` (provided by the runner as
  floor(submit_ts_ms/window). For each bucket, add `0.25 × max(0, distinct-1)`.
  This rewards distinct effects within the same nonce window (composition).
- **Penalty:** For every occurrence of a signature beyond the cap, add `0.1` to
  penalty. No-op steps (failed acknowledgements) neither add to Base nor incur
  penalties.

Refer to `docs/PLAN_3_2.md` §2–§4 for worked examples and the scoring rationale.

## Dataset & Tasks

### Coverage tasks (`dataset/tasks/*.jsonl`)

- `hl_perp_basic_01.jsonl` – place two ETH orders (ALO + GTC) and cancel last.
- `hl_cancel_sweep_01.jsonl` – rest an ETH order, wait 150 ms, cancel all.
- `hl_risk_and_account_01.jsonl` – transfer USDC to perp, set leverage, place IOC reduce-only order.

Each file is documented in `dataset/tasks/README.md`. Append `:<line>` when
referencing them from the runner. Extend the directory with your own deterministic
scenarios to grow coverage.

### HiaN cases (`dataset/hian/*`)

- `case_128k/prompt.txt` – compact noisy-context seed containing a single needle
  instruction: transfer 7.5 USDC to perps, place an ALO bid mid−1% on ETH.
- `case_128k/ground_truth.json` – required ordered effects for PASS.
- `case_128k/meta.json` – metadata (case ID, token estimate, prompt hash).

The HiaN CLI parses these files, matches effects, and emits `eval_hian.json`
plus diffs. You can scale prompts to the desired token count and update
metadata accordingly.

### Versioning & reproducibility

- Keep datasets under git for deterministic scoring. When prompts exceed version
control limits, store the SHA256 in `meta.json` and host the blob externally.
- Bumping signature grammar or domain rules requires a new `version` field in
  `domains-hl.yaml` and communication to users (see `docs/PLAN_4.md` §4.7).

## Frontend Snapshot

The static frontend under `frontend/` reads two data sources:
- `frontend/data/models.json` – leaderboard entries (agent name, rank, scores,
  domain breakdown, artifact paths).
- `frontend/data/samples/<run>/` – evaluator outputs (`per_action.jsonl`,
  `eval_score.json`, `unique_signatures.json`, etc.).

Entry points:
- `index.html` – overview with leaderboard and charts (Chart.js via CDN).
- `trajectories.html` – action log explorer; upload a run directory or pick a
  hosted sample to inspect per-step signatures and raw details.
- `lc.html` – domain breakdown table with links to policies and signature manifests.

Serve locally:
```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8000
```

Deploy to any static host (Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages). Update the
JSON under `frontend/data/` whenever you publish new runs.

---

## Builder Code & Monetization

- Specify `--builder-code <CODE>` (or `HL_BUILDER_CODE`) when running coverage.
- When supported by the Hyperliquid SDK, orders posted through `hl-runner` will
  attribute flow to this code. The evaluator doesn’t read the builder code but
  it is stored in `orders_routed.csv` for downstream analytics.
- The CSV schema (`ts, oid, coin, side, px, sz, tif, reduceOnly, builderCode`) is
  designed for ingestion into dashboards or revenue sharing reports.

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **No websocket confirmation:** The runner records missing confirmations in the
  `notes` field of `per_action.jsonl`. Increase `--effect-timeout-ms` if your
  environment has higher latency.
- **Signature unmatched:** The evaluator warns if a signature doesn’t match any
  domain (it lands in `unmapped_signatures.json`). Update `domains-hl.yaml`
  carefully and bump `version` for scoring changes.
- **Penalty spikes:** Check `per_signature_counts` inside `eval_score.json` to see
  which signatures exceeded the cap. Adjust plans or caps as needed.
- **HiaN development:** `scripts/run_hian.sh` runs a local demo plan and invokes
  `hl-evaluator hian`, writing `eval_hian.json` and a diff on failure.
- **CI integration:** Use `scripts/run_cov.sh` in GitHub Actions to guard lagoon
  runs. Persist the `runs/<ts>/` directory as an artifact for inspection.
