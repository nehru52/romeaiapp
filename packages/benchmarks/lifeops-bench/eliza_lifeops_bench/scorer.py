"""Pure scoring functions for LifeOpsBench.

Composes state-hash equality, ground-truth action overlap, and required-output
substring presence into a per-scenario score. `pass_at_k` is the standard
HumanEval/Chen-2021 unbiased estimator.

Score formula:
    STATIC mode: 0.5 * state_hash_match + 0.4 * action_score
                 + 0.1 * mean(output_substring_matches)
    LIVE  mode: 0.7 * state_hash_match
                 + 0.3 * mean(output_substring_matches)

PerfectAgent must produce 1.0 on every supported scenario.
WrongAgent must produce 0.0 on every scenario.

    STATIC weighting depends on whether the scenario's ground-truth
    actions all canonicalize to runner-no-op reads:

    * WRITE scenarios (at least one mutating GT action):
          0.5 state_hash + 0.4 action_score + 0.1 substring_score.
      State hash is the executor's verdict on whether the world ended up
      where it was supposed to, so it's the dominant signal.

    * READ scenarios (every GT action is a runner no-op like
      CALENDAR/check_availability, MONEY/dashboard, HEALTH/today, …):
          0.1 state_hash + 0.7 action_score + 0.2 substring_score.
      The runner can't tell correct from incorrect read calls — both
      replays produce identical state hashes. Re-weighting forces
      action correctness to dominate so a malformed BLOCK or a
      `source: gmail`-mismatched MESSAGE/read_with_contact actually
      loses points instead of getting the 0.5 state_hash freebie.

    * READ_WITH_SIDE_EFFECTS scenarios (every GT action is a read or a
      read-with-side-effects op like LIFE/review or HEALTH/summary, with
      at least one side-effecting action present):
          0.15 state_hash + 0.3 action_score + 0.55 substring_score.
      These operations write small metadata mutations (e.g. last_reviewed_at)
      so the state hash is no longer trivially unchanged — but the primary
      signal is still action + output correctness, not the mutation. The
      0.15 state weight acknowledges the side-effect without giving the full
      write weight (0.5) to the hash component.

    * MIXED scenarios (some reads/rwse + some writes): split the difference,
      keeping state_hash credibility for the write portion while
      penalizing wrong reads — 0.35 state_hash + 0.5 action_score +
      0.15 substring_score.

    LIVE weighting (no GT actions, judged by world hash + judge):
          0.7 state_hash + 0.3 substring_score.
