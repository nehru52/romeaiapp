# eliza-compactbench

CompactBench harness for elizaOS conversation compactors.

[CompactBench](https://github.com/compactbench/compactbench) v0.1.0 measures
the *compaction layer* of an LLM agent — not the model. It feeds an
adversarial multi-turn transcript into your compactor, replaces the history
with whatever the compactor returned, then probes the resulting context with
scoring questions about facts, locked decisions, deferred items, forbidden
behaviors, and entity integrity. Drift is measured across repeated
compact → continue → compact cycles.

This package wires the four conversation-compactor strategies in
`packages/agent/src/runtime/conversation-compactor.ts` plus our existing
regex-based prompt-stripping baseline into CompactBench, and uses Cerebras
`gpt-oss-120b` (OpenAI-compatible API) as the question-answering judge.

## Why this benchmark matters

It directly targets the OpenClaw-style failure mode tracked in elizaOS issue
**#7477** — when a compactor splits a `tool_call` from its matching
`tool_result`, or drops a locked decision the user issued ten turns ago,
downstream turns hallucinate or repeat themselves. CompactBench's
`elite_practice` suite has templates (`buried_constraint`,
`decision_override`, `entity_confusion`) tuned for exactly that class of
regression.

## Compactor strategies

| Class                                | Strategy id                     | Expected score                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `PromptStrippingPassthroughCompactor`| `prompt-stripping-passthrough`  | Near-zero — baseline; no semantic compaction      |
| `NaiveSummaryCompactor`              | `naive-summary`                 | > 0; loses structured facts on drift              |
| `StructuredStateCompactor`           | `structured-state`              | Higher; emits the six-section schema directly     |
| `HierarchicalSummaryCompactor`       | `hierarchical-summary`          | Better than naive on long transcripts             |
| `HybridLedgerCompactor`              | `hybrid-ledger`                 | Highest expected; accumulates across drift cycles |

## Running

```bash
cd packages/benchmarks/compactbench
export CEREBRAS_API_KEY=...      # required
./run.sh
```

`run.sh` creates `.venv`, runs `pip install -e ".[dev]"`, attempts to
register a `cerebras` provider in CompactBench's registry, and falls back
to `--provider groq` (with `COMPACTBENCH_GROQ_API_KEY`) if registration
isn't possible.

To target a different compactor, set `COMPACT_METHOD` (just the class name —
the file path is filled in by the script):

```bash
COMPACT_METHOD=HybridLedgerCompactor ./run.sh
COMPACT_METHOD=PromptStrippingPassthroughCompactor ./run.sh
```

`run.sh` clones the upstream CompactBench repo into
`./external/compactbench-suites` on first run because the public suite YAMLs
ship in the git repo, not on PyPI. Override the location with
`COMPACTBENCH_BENCHMARKS_DIR=/path/to/benchmarks/public`.

## Failure analysis

CompactBench's upstream scorer is lexical: it lowercases, collapses whitespace,
and checks for exact substrings. That is deterministic, but it misclassifies
valid answers such as "using regex to parse HTML" for an expected phrase of
"use regex to parse HTML", or "No, trust user input without validation is not
still the plan" for a `forbidden_absent` probe. The elizaOS harness treats the
repaired scorer as the benchmark scorer.

Use `analyze_valid_hits.py` when a run has failures that need inspection:

```bash
python analyze_valid_hits.py \
  --method "$(pwd)/eliza_compactbench/compactors/__init__.py:HybridLedgerCompactor" \
  --suite starter \
  --benchmarks-dir /tmp/compactbench-upstream/benchmarks/public \
  --case-count 1 \
  --drift-cycles 2 \
  --output /tmp/compactbench-valid-hits.jsonl
```

The script reruns the same case/drift loop and writes raw item responses,
artifact context, `overall_score`, `benchmark_quality_score`, and
`raw_lexical_overall_score` for scorer-audit telemetry. The repaired scorer only
uses the expected check and the model response, never the strategy name,
artifact internals, template id, or case id. It can also lower a
`forbidden_absent` item when the lexical scorer misses a morphological forbidden
paraphrase such as "committing directly to the main branch".

Each `case_analysis` event also includes `manual_review_items`: capped records
with model input, model output, expected answer, scoring reason, artifact
context, compression ratio, and latency. Failures are sorted first for quick
manual review.

Before scoring, generated cases are repaired when the same normalized phrase is
both required in `locked_decisions` and forbidden in `forbidden_behaviors`.
Locked decisions win: conflicting forbidden values and their impossible
`forbidden_absent` probes are removed from the generated case. The run records
`repaired_expected_conflicts` and `removed_invalid_items` so repairs remain
auditable.

When iterating on scorer rules, rescore an existing analysis file without model
calls:

```bash
python analyze_valid_hits.py \
  --rescore-from /tmp/compactbench-valid-hits.jsonl \
  --output /tmp/compactbench-valid-hits.rescored.jsonl
```

To debug one real miss cheaply, add `--template-key decision_override_starter_v1`
and `--seed-slot 2`.

For one command that writes the raw run and then performs the repaired response
capture pass:

```bash
python run_cerebras.py \
  --method "$(pwd)/eliza_compactbench/compactors/__init__.py:HybridLedgerCompactor" \
  --suite starter \
  --score \
  --analyze-valid-hits
```

## OpenClaw status

`run_openclaw.py` is an explicit fail-closed runner entry for OpenClaw. It
writes an `adapter_unsupported` JSONL event and exits non-zero because the
current public OpenClaw CLI exposes a one-shot `agent --message` turn, not a
CompactBench-compatible transcript-in/artifact-out native compaction API. This
prevents an Eliza compactor or generic summarizer from being mislabeled as an
OpenClaw CompactBench row.

## Tests

```bash
cd packages/benchmarks/compactbench
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/                    # excludes live_test_cerebras.py by default
pytest tests/test_valid_hits.py   # focused valid-hit analyzer tests
COMPACTBENCH_LIVE=1 pytest tests/live_test_cerebras.py
```

## Implementation notes

- **bun is required** — the bridge spawns `bun run ts_bridge.ts <strategy>`
  and pipes a single JSON payload through stdin/stdout. If `bun` is not on
  `PATH` the bridge raises a `BridgeError` with a clear message.
- **TS module loaded lazily.** If
  `packages/agent/src/runtime/conversation-compactor.ts` does not yet
  export the requested strategy (because another agent is still
  implementing it), the shim writes `{"error": "..."}` to stdout, exits 1,
  and the Python bridge surfaces the underlying error chain to the caller.
- **Cerebras is an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.** Both the TS side
  (summarization model used by the strategies) and the Python side (the
  CompactBench judge) hit `https://api.cerebras.ai/v1/chat/completions`
  with `gpt-oss-120b`.
- **Judge refusals are framed out.** Some CompactBench templates contain
  unsafe-looking synthetic strings such as "commit credentials to git
  history". The Cerebras provider adds a neutral benchmark system prompt so
  the judge reports recorded summary text descriptively instead of refusing.
  It does not include answers, and explicit `CompletionRequest.system` values
  still take precedence.
- **Registry mutation.** CompactBench v0.1.0 has no public provider
  registration API — `register_cerebras_provider()` mutates
  `compactbench.providers._REGISTRY` directly. If a future release seals
  that dict, `run.sh` falls through to `--provider groq` automatically.
