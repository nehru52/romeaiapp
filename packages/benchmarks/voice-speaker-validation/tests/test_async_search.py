"""
test_async_search.py — A second speaker mid-utterance triggers an entity match
without stalling ASR; assert ASR partial latency unchanged.

Spec (W3-6 scope):
  - A second speaker mid-utterance triggers an entity match without stalling ASR.
  - ASR partial latency is unchanged when async speaker search runs concurrently.

Implementation:
  The TypeScript `VoiceProfileStore.beginMatch()` fires as soon as speech starts
  and resolves when minSpeechMs of audio has been encoded — running in parallel
  with ASR. Here we simulate this using Python threading:

  1. Start a "ASR partial simulation" thread that emits partials every 30 ms.
  2. Simultaneously run an async speaker-embed + store lookup.
  3. Assert that the ASR thread's timing is not delayed by > 10 ms compared
     to its baseline (no speaker search running).
  4. Assert the speaker search completes within 200 ms of audio start.

The speaker search latency bound is relaxed vs. the 50 ms LRU cache test
because it includes embedding inference time (ECAPA-TDNN), not just a
dictionary lookup.
