"""Context-bench query function backed by OpenClaw.

Mirrors :func:`eliza_adapter.context_bench.make_eliza_llm_query` and
:func:`hermes_adapter.context_bench.make_hermes_llm_query`: returns an
``async def query(context: str, question: str) -> str``.

The adapter is intentionally thin — context-bench has no tool use, no
multi-turn state. We thread the prompt through OpenClawClient and return
the assistant text. With ``OPENCLAW_DIRECT_OPENAI_COMPAT=1`` the client
hits Cerebras directly, which is the supported smoke path.
