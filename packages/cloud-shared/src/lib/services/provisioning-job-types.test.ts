/**
 * Tests for the provisioning job LANES — the split that lets a dedicated
 * apps-control daemon claim only the `apps` lane (CONTAINER_* / APP_*) while the
 * agent control-plane worker keeps the `agent` lane, both sharing one `jobs`
 * table. Two properties matter most:
 *
 *   1. COMPLETENESS — every JOB_TYPES value belongs to exactly one lane. A type
 *      in NEITHER lane would be silently un-claimable by any scoped daemon
 *      (stuck pending forever); a type in BOTH would be double-claimed.
 *   2. FAIL-OPEN — an empty/garbage `PROVISIONING_JOB_LANES` resolves to ALL
 *      types (the historical single-daemon behavior), never to "claim nothing".
