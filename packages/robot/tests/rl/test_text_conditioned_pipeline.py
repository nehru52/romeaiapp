"""End-to-end smoke test for the text-conditioned skill pipeline.

The path under test:

    user text  →  CommandParser.parse(text)
                       │
                       └─ ParseResult(skill_name, params, confidence)
                                           │
                                           ▼
    SkillRegistry.get(skill_name)  →  BaseSkill instance
                                           │
                                           ├─ reset(params)
                                           └─ get_action(obs)  →  joint targets

This verifies the actual pipeline that Eliza's `AINEX_PICK_UP` /
`AINEX_RUN_ACTION_GROUP` style actions invoke when they call `policy.start`
with a text task: parsing must reliably map common chat phrases to
canonical skill names, and the resolved skill must produce in-range
joint targets without crashing.

Slow imports (TextEncoder pulls sentence-transformers if available) are
gated — we use the bag-of-words fallback so the test runs in CI.
