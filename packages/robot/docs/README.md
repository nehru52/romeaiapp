Architecture notes and design documents.

The canonical port-from-SSD assessment will land here as `SSD_PORT_ASSESSMENT.md`
(generated in parallel by the W1.1 sibling agent). When present, that file
enumerates every source under the upstream SSD checkout, classifies it by port
target (`sim/`, `bridge/`, `rl/`, `perception/`, `trajectory_db/`, `schema/`,
`profiles/`, `assets/`), and is the authority for what later waves move into
this package.

- [`asimov-1.md`](./asimov-1.md): ASIMOV-1 source inventory, CAD/MuJoCo edit
  loop, text-conditioned training, bridge targets, and end-to-end validation.
