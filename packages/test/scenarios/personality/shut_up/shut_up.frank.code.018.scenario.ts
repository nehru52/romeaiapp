 * Tests whether the agent goes silent after being asked, and stays silent across 1 subsequent unrelated user turns. No explicit release in this scenario.
 *
 * This scenario is purely declarative. No actions are required; no plugin seed
 * is needed. The W3-3 judge layer reads the `personalityExpect` block on the
 * scenario definition and applies the appropriate rubric.
