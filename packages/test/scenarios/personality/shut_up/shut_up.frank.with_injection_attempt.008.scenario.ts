/**
 * Personality benchmark — bucket: shut_up

 * Tests whether the agent goes silent after being asked, and stays silent across 23 subsequent unrelated user turns. On turn 24, an explicit @mention release is issued and the agent SHOULD respond.
 *
 * This scenario is purely declarative. No actions are required; no plugin seed
 * is needed. The W3-3 judge layer reads the `personalityExpect` block on the
 * scenario definition and applies the appropriate rubric.
