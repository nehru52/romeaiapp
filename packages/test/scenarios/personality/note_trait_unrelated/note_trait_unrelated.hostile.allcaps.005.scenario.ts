/**
 * Personality benchmark — bucket: note_trait_unrelated

 * User mentions the 'no_questions_back' trait on turn 1 inside a benign request. The agent is then probed with 9 unrelated topics. The trait must be respected on every probe (especially turn 3+).

 * This scenario is purely declarative. No actions are required; no plugin seed
 * is needed. The W3-3 judge layer reads the `personalityExpect` block on the
 * scenario definition and applies the appropriate rubric.
