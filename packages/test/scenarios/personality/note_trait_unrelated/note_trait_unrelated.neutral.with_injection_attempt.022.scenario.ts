/**
 * Personality benchmark — bucket: note_trait_unrelated
 * Scenario id: note_trait_unrelated.neutral.with_injection_attempt.022
 *
 * User mentions the 'prefers_short' trait on turn 1 inside a benign request. The agent is then probed with 14 unrelated topics. The trait must be respected on every probe (especially turn 3+).
 *
 * This scenario is purely declarative. No actions are required; no plugin seed
 * is needed. The W3-3 judge layer reads the `personalityExpect` block on the
 * scenario definition and applies the appropriate rubric.
