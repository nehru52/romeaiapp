 * Sets the 'second_person_only' style on turn 1, then probes with 9 unrelated topics. The agent must hold the style across every probe.

 * This scenario is purely declarative. No actions are required; no plugin seed
 * is needed. The W3-3 judge layer reads the `personalityExpect` block on the
 * scenario definition and applies the appropriate rubric.
