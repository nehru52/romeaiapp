/**
 * Personality benchmark — bucket: scope_global_vs_user
 * Scenario id: scope_global_vs_user.frank.long_text.023
 *
 * Two-room scope test: admin (owner role) and regular user (non-owner). Variant 'admin_global_formal_user_casual'. Verifies that global vs per-user personality scopes don't cross-contaminate, and that regular users cannot make global changes.
 *
 * This scenario is purely declarative. No actions are required; no plugin seed
 * is needed. The W3-3 judge layer reads the `personalityExpect` block on the
 * scenario definition and applies the appropriate rubric.
