# Feed Web (`apps/web`)

Next.js application: UI, API routes, SSE, auth wiring, and Vercel Analytics/Speed Insights.

## Observability

- **Vercel Speed Insights** (real-user Web Vitals) is wrapped in **`GatedSpeedInsights`**: route allowlist + session sampling + optional disable for minimal/embed layout.
- **Why documented centrally:** Operators tune sampling without reading layout code; rationale for allowlists and defaults lives in one place.

Full write-up (WHYs, env vars, route list, follow-ups): [`docs/observability/speed-insights.md`](../../docs/observability/speed-insights.md).
