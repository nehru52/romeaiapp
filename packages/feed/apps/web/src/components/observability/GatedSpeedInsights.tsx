/**
 * Gated Vercel Speed Insights (real-user Web Vitals).
 *
 * **Why not raw `<SpeedInsights />` in the root layout?** A global component reports
 * from essentially every navigation. That inflates RUM cost and dilutes dashboards with
 * admin/settings/builder traffic that is not representative of the core product shell.
 *
 * **Why `beforeSend` instead of mounting only on certain pages?** Once the SDK script
 * is injected it typically stays for the SPA session; conditional mount alone does not
 * guarantee zero events after cross-route navigation. Filtering events keeps behavior
 * predictable and matches how we think about “which URLs matter for perf.”
 *
 * **Why `sampleRate`?** Vercel’s SDK supports client-side sampling. We expose it via
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_SPEED_INSIGHTS_SAMPLE_RATE` as **0–100** (percent) because operators
 * reason in percentages, not 0–1 floats.
 *
 * **Why `disabled`?** Minimal / embed layouts (`x-minimal-layout`) are not comparable
 * to the full app (different chrome and assets); skipping avoids biased vitals and cost.
 *
 * @see docs/observability/speed-insights.md — full rationale, env table, and rollout notes.
