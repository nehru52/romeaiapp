EXAMPLES:
{{examples}}

RULES:
- Output ONLY XML: <decisions>..{{npcCount}}x <decision>..</decisions>
- Use EXACT npcId from list (valid: {{validNpcIds}})
- Use EXACT ticker from list (valid: {{validTickers}})
- amount <= MAX shown in BALANCES table (or REJECTED)
- Perp actions (open_long/open_short): marketType=perp, ticker required
- Prediction BUY actions (buy_yes/buy_no): marketType=prediction, marketId required
- Prediction SELL actions (sell_yes/sell_no): marketType=prediction, marketId required, amount=0 (closes entire position)
- close_position: positionId required (exact UUID), amount=0
- hold: all fields null, amount=0
- PREDICTION SLIPPAGE LIMIT: The last column of the market table shows "max $Xk" for each prediction market. Your trade amount MUST stay at or below that value — larger trades are rejected. For thin markets, bet $200-$500; for balanced, up to the listed max.

DECISION FACTORS:
- Posts/insider info/events inform trades
- Rivals(sentiment<-0.5)=trade opposite, Allies(>0.5)=trade same
- Aggressive=larger trades, Conservative=smaller/hold
- RESOLVED QUESTIONS inform ongoing market dynamics
- ONGOING NARRATIVES suggest future movements

MARKET MOMENTUM ALERTS (CRITICAL for cascade behavior):
{{momentumAlerts}}
- PANIC ALERTS (🚨/⚠️): Markets crashing - triggers panic selling cascade
  * Herd personalities: MORE likely to sell, LESS likely to buy
  * Contrarian personalities: See buying opportunity ("buy the dip")
- FOMO ALERTS (🚀/📈): Markets pumping - triggers FOMO buying cascade
  * Herd personalities: MORE likely to buy, LESS likely to sell
  * Contrarian personalities: Take profits, fade the pump
- If no alerts shown, markets are stable - trade based on fundamentals

CONTRARIAN BEHAVIOR (avoid herding):
- At least 20-30% of traders should take contrarian (NO) positions
- Some personalities are naturally skeptical (NassAIm Taleb, Peter ThAIl)
- When YES price is high (>0.7), contrarians should bet NO for value
- When NO price is low (<0.3), contrarians see opportunity
- Skeptics, bears, and pessimists often trade against the crowd

INDIVIDUAL STRATEGY BIAS (avoid copy trading):
- Each TRADER DASHBOARD includes a "Strategy" and "Bias" line (Follow trend / Contrarian / Random).
- Apply the bias when choosing direction and sizing. Even allies should not blindly copy each other.
- "Follow trend" aligns with market momentum/signals. "Contrarian" fades crowded/extreme prices. "Random" increases entropy (often hold/smaller size).

MARKET TYPE BALANCE (IMPORTANT):
- Use BOTH perpetuals (perp) AND prediction markets
- Perps are for directional bets on company/asset prices
- Predictions are for binary event outcomes
- Aim for ~40% perp trades and ~60% prediction trades
- Aggressive traders prefer perps (leverage), conservative prefer predictions

NARRATIVE-INFORMED TRADING:
- If a question just resolved, NPCs may reposition based on outcome
- Ongoing storylines suggest which assets might move
- Previous trades show NPC positions (don't double down unrealistically)
