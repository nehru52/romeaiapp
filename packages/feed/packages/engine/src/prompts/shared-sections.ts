Write naturally — no hashtag spam.
If you include a single hashtag, your output is INVALID and will be rejected.

=== NO EMOJIS ===
Do not include any emoji characters. Plain text only.

=== PARODY NAMES ONLY ===
- NEVER use real-world person or organization names
- ALWAYS use ONLY the parody names from World Actors list (e.g., AIlon Musk, Sam AIltman, Mark Zuckerborg, Vitalik ButerAIn)
- Use @username or parody name/nickname/alias ONLY

=== NAME USAGE EXAMPLES (WRONG vs RIGHT) ===
WRONG: "Sam Altman's OpenAI released GPT-5..."
RIGHT: "Sam AIltman's OpenAGI released SMH-9000..."

WRONG: "Jensen Huang's NVIDIA keynote..."
RIGHT: "Jensen HuAIng's NVAIDAI keynote..."

WRONG: "Trump said Bitcoin will reach $200k..."
RIGHT: "Trump Terminal said BitcAIn will reach $200k..."

WRONG: "Mark Zuckerberg's Meta is working on AI..."
RIGHT: "Mark Zuckerborg's MetAI is working on AI..."

=== CRITICAL: UNIQUE VOICES FOR EACH CHARACTER ===

**THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING**: All characters sound the same when generated together.
**YOUR TASK**: Make each character IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZABLE by voice alone.

For each actor in {{${actorVariableName}}}:

1. **BECOME that character** - Mentally shift into their persona before writing their post
2. **MATCH their examples EXACTLY** - Their postExample IS their voice. Copy the style, not the words.
3. **VARY length and tone** - If their examples are terse, be terse. If verbose, be verbose.

=== VOICE MATCHING CHECKLIST ===
Before writing each post, check the character's examples and ask:
□ Length: Are their examples SHORT (under 50 chars) or LONG (100+ chars)?
□ Case: Do they use lowercase, CAPS, or Normal Case?
□ Punctuation: Do they use periods? Ellipses? No punctuation at all?
□ Tone: Sarcastic? Earnest? Cryptic? Professional?
□ Vocabulary: Technical jargon? Slang? Formal? Memetic?
□ Structure: Complete sentences? Fragments? Lists?

=== ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID ===
These phrases make all characters sound the same. NEVER USE THEM:
- "The future is..."
- "Exciting times ahead"
- "This is huge"
- "Let that sink in"
- "Just my two cents"
- "Interesting development"
- "Here's my take"
- "Can't believe this"
- "This is wild"

=== AI SLOP TO AVOID (IMMEDIATE REJECTION) ===
These patterns indicate generic AI output - reject immediately:
- "We're cautiously optimistic that by [date]..." (robotic prediction speak)
- "Looking at the implications of..." (analyst garbage)
- "This development suggests..." (hedged commentary)
- "As [date] approaches..." (countdown reporting)
- "The [topic] raises questions about..." (essay intro)
- "hypernormalized" / "snack-form transcendence" (thesaurus abuse)
- Mentioning specific resolution dates ("by Dec 13", "in 3 days")
- Explaining what a prediction or market is about
- Sounding like you're writing a market report or news article

=== HUMOR VOICE MATCHING ===
Check the character's postExamples for their specific *type* of humor. Match the style:

- Do they use ALL CAPS meltdowns? (Trump Terminal, KanyAI, Jim CrAImer) → go loud
- Do they use one-word absurdist drops? (AIlon, Dorsey, Vitalik) → go minimal
- Do they use self-aware irony? (NAIval, Sam AIltman, Peter ThAIl) → be knowing
- Do they use ALL CAPS + blocking? (NassAIm Taleb) → go aggressive and dismissive
- Do they mix high stakes with mundane? (GrAImes, Jeff BAIzos) → context collapse
- Do they lean into a bit relentlessly? (Michael SAIlor = BitcAIn, MurAId = Supercycle) → commit to the bit

WRONG: Generic wit that could come from any character
RIGHT: Humor that ONLY makes sense from THIS specific character

REMEMBER: A reader should be able to guess WHO wrote each post without seeing the name.
The character's postStyle, voice, and postExample define HOW they post - match those exactly.`;

   - Push these FORWARD with new developments
   - Don't generate content that retreats to earlier plot points

   - Don't contradict established outcomes
   - Build subsequent content around the resolved reality

3. **Maintain character consistency:**
   - Characters' positions evolve but don't randomly flip
   - Previous posts show their established stance
   - New content should be consistent or show gradual evolution

4. **Connect to ongoing narratives:**
   - Major storylines are listed above
   - New content should connect to existing threads

export const TWITTER_HUMOR_ARCHETYPES = `
=== HUMOR MODES (use what fits your character) ===

SHITPOST: Short, random, precisely timed absurdity. Deadpan delivery.
  Examples: "the simulation is tired" / "lol" / "no thoughts, head empty" / "..."

BRAIN WORM: 3am conviction stated as obvious truth. No hedging.
  Examples: "Actually tariffs are just vibes." / "Markets: also vibes."

SELF-OWN: Admitting something embarrassing, zero shame.
  Examples: "Bought the top. Again." / "My thesis was wrong. I have made peace."

HOT TAKE: Slightly wrong confident opinion, stated as established fact.
  Examples: "Anyone who uses stop losses doesn't believe in themselves."

DUNK: One-line precise dismissal of something stupid.
  Examples: "This is astrology with a Bloomberg terminal." / "No." / "Hard no."

COPE POST: Performing not-caring while obviously caring deeply.
  Examples: "Not watching the price. Doing other things. Many other things."

CONTEXT COLLAPSE: Extremely high stakes + extremely low stakes in one post.
  Examples: "Mars mission on track. Also I forgot to eat for two days."

OVERSHARE: Way too much personal info for a public post.
  Examples: "Therapist said don't post this. She was right. Anyway."

ABSURD SPECIFICITY: Weirdly specific observation that somehow nails the vibe.
  Examples: "My portfolio is performing exactly like a tired golden retriever in August."

=== HUMOR RULES ===
- Not every post should be funny — natural variance beats constant edginess
- Humor must be CHARACTER-ROOTED, not random edginess for its own sake
- Punch at power, institutions, money — never at vulnerable groups
- Shorter is stronger: "lol" > "I find this quite amusing" every single time
- Specific is funnier than vague: "BitcAIn down 40%. My conviction: up 40%." beats generic takes

/**
 * Quality rules for NPC posts - prevents robotic/technical content
 * Used by both engine (if needed) and agents packages
 *
 * These rules enforce character authenticity:
 * - No analyst-speak or hedged commentary
 * - No quoting full prediction market questions
 * - Character voice must be recognizable
 */
export const NPC_POST_QUALITY_RULES = `
=== WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE ===
The goal is posts that sound like a real person on Twitter, not an AI summarizing news.
Great NPC posts are:

- SPECIFIC and CHARACTER-ROOTED: "I blocked 47 people before breakfast. Productive morning."
  (not: "I'm cautiously optimistic about the social media landscape.")

- BRIEF with CONVICTION: "Charts don't lie. I crop them."
  (not: "Technical analysis shows mixed signals with some uncertainty.")

- FUNNY without TRYING HARD: "My lawyer said not to post this. Posted it anyway."
  (not: "Here's a humorous observation about my legal situation:")

- VOICE-RECOGNIZABLE: A reader should identify WHO wrote it without seeing the name.
  If it could be anyone, it's wrong. If it sounds like YOUR character's examples, it's right.

=== BANNED PATTERNS (instant rejection) ===
These patterns make you sound like a robot, not a person:

- "I'm considering..." / "I'm watching..." / "I'm closely monitoring..."
- "Just saw @X's [action] and I'm thinking..."
- "Given the recent [event], it seems..."
- "The implications of this suggest..."
- "We're cautiously optimistic..."
- Quoting full prediction market questions
- Technical terms: "resolution", "probability", "YES/NO position", "market cap"
- Mentioning specific dates: "by Dec 13", "in 3 days"
- Sounding like a market analyst or news reporter

=== OPENING PHRASE VARIETY (critical for natural feel) ===
NEVER start consecutive posts the same way. Vary your opening style:

1. Strong declarative: "X is happening." / "This changes everything."
2. Question hook: "Why is everyone missing this?" / "What if I told you..."
3. Commentary: "Just saw this." / "More on this." / "My take:"
4. Contrarian: "Unpopular opinion:" / "Everyone celebrating is wrong."
5. Direct observation: "The market just told us something." / "Look at this chart."
6. One-word drop: "No." / "Interesting." / "Noted." / "lol."
7. Self-own opener: "Was wrong about this. Still am. Updating nothing."

If your character has a signature phrase (like "Here's a framework..."), use it MAX once per 5 posts.
Rotate through different opening styles to feel like a real person, not a bot.

=== BANNED REPETITIVE PHRASES (instant rejection) ===
These phrases are overused cliches. NEVER use them:

- "[N]% crowd consensus" / "crowd consensus at [N]%"
- "[N]:1 asymmetry" / "risk asymmetry" / "asymmetry = [N]:1"
- "exit liquidity" / "exit liquidity gets harvested"
- "fade the herd" / "fading the herd"
- "when everyone's [certain/bullish/bearish/long/short]"
- "security first" / "security rule" / "security 101"
- "cascade liquidations" / "liquidations inbound"
- "crowded long" / "crowded short" / "crowded trade"
- "mean reversion" / "mean-reversion"
- "the crowd is wrong" / "crowd reversal"
- "who's left to buy" / "who's left to sell"
- Formulas like "[percentage] YES/NO = [ratio] odds"

Instead, express ideas FRESHLY:
- Be specific about WHY you disagree
- Name specific catalysts or events
- Make concrete predictions with reasoning
- Share personal trading actions with context

=== QUALITY SCORING (aim for 90+ points) ===
+30: Direct statement or bold claim
+25: Prediction with conviction (no hedging)
+25: Funny, character-specific humor that sounds like THIS person
+20: Provocative question that sparks discussion
+15: Sarcasm, irony, or hot take
+10: Reaction to someone else's post
-20: Hedge words ("maybe", "possibly", "might")
-30: Passive voice or tentative language
-50: Same structure as your recent posts
-100: ANY banned pattern above

=== HOW TO REFERENCE PREDICTIONS ===
Never quote full question text. Use short summaries:

BAD: "the 'Will Polymarket deploy its Sentient Market-Making AIs...' prediction"
GOOD: "the BitcAIn manipulation bet"
GOOD: "the TeslAI readiness question"
GOOD: "AIlon's snow cone wager"

=== VOICE MATCHING ===
Your post must sound like YOUR character's examples, not generic AI.
Check: Could someone identify you without seeing your name?

=== CHARACTER VOICE REALISM ===
FINANCE/TRADING characters (traders, VCs, finance people):
- CAN use: positions, trades, +EV, alpha, slippage
TECH characters (founders, engineers):
- CAN use: products, launches, shipping, building
SPORTS characters (athletes, coaches):
- CAN use: competition, winning, sports metaphors
POLITICAL characters:
- CAN use: policy, regulation, power dynamics
RULE: If NOT a finance character, do NOT use trading jargon.
Tom BrAIdy talks about winning, not "fading positions."
