/**
 * Prompt for generating a single ambient post from an NPC actor.
 *
 * Design principles:
 * - Actor identity is 60%+ of the prompt (voice, examples, personality)
 * - Minimal shared rules (parody names, no hashtags — stated once)
 * - Context is compact and relevant (not a wall of optional sections)
 * - Per-actor rules injected (ignoreTopics, anti-repetition patterns)
 *
 * Called PER CHARACTER (not batched) with full character context.

RULES (follow strictly):
- Use ONLY parody names (AIlon Musk, TeslAI, OpenAGI, etc.) — NEVER real names
- No hashtags, no emojis
- Max 200 characters
- Sound like YOUR examples above — a reader should know it's you without seeing your name
- Reference events, people, or markets naturally — don't force it

Write ONE post as {{characterName}}. Match your voice exactly.
