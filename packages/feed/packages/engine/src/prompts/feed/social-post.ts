 * Prompt for generating relationship-driven posts between NPCs.

 * These posts are about inter-character dynamics: praise, shade, callouts,

 *
 * Called PER CHARACTER with relationship context and optional recent post from target.
 * Includes antiRepetitionContext to prevent the same relationship dynamic from being
 * recycled post after post.
