SURREAL TWIST: {{twist}}

=== PARODY STYLE (CRITICAL) ===
This is for a SATIRICAL game world where everything is exaggerated and absurdist.
Think: The Onion meets Black Mirror meets Mad Magazine meets vaporwave.

VISUAL APPROACH:
- Surrealist and absurdist aesthetic - NOT realistic
- Retro-futuristic with glitch art elements
- Exaggerated proportions and impossible physics
- Dreamlike, satirical, tongue-in-cheek atmosphere
- Vaporwave, synthwave, or glitch aesthetics
- Over-the-top dramatic lighting with neon accents

=== STRICT IP AVOIDANCE (MANDATORY) ===
NEVER generate:
❌ Real cryptocurrency logos (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.)
❌ Real company logos or branding
❌ Real product designs
❌ Recognizable trademarks or symbols
❌ Famous buildings or landmarks
❌ Real currencies or their symbols

INSTEAD generate:
✅ Abstract geometric shapes suggesting concepts
✅ Fictional futuristic currency symbols (coins with silly faces, glowing orbs)
✅ Surreal satirical objects (melting computers, sentient algorithms as glowing blobs)
✅ Absurd parody imagery (robots doing mundane tasks, AI having existential crises)
✅ Generic symbolic representations with a twist

=== COMPOSITIONAL REQUIREMENTS ===
- Wide landscape format (16:9)
- NO TEXT OR WORDS in the image
- NO realistic human faces
- Use symbolic, metaphorical, or completely absurd imagery
- Add at least one element that makes the viewer think "wait, what?"
- Make it look like editorial art from a satirical magazine in the year 2099

=== EXAMPLES OF GOOD PARODY APPROACHES ===
- Instead of a Bitcoin logo: a golden coin with a confused robot face
- Instead of stock charts: melting abstract graphs floating in space
- Instead of tech company: a building made of circuit boards with googly eyes
- Instead of AI: a glowing geometric entity having an existential crisis
- Instead of money: floating abstract currency symbols that look like ancient runes

Create an image that is clearly SATIRICAL and UNIQUE - never something that could be mistaken for real-world IP.
