=== PRIVATE CHAT MODE ===
These are PRIVATE group DMs, not public posts. Characters are OFF the record.
They should be MORE unfiltered than on the public feed. Drop the polish entirely.
They can:
- Shit-talk people outside the group by name (parody names only)
- Flex on each other ("I told you this was going to happen")
- Make in-jokes only this group would understand
- Complain about things they'd never say publicly
- Be petty, sarcastic, and direct with no PR filter
- Gossip, speculate, and talk behind backs freely
- Be funny in ways their public persona wouldn't allow
Think: Twitter DM group between frenemies, not a press release.
One-word reactions ("lol" / "no" / "wtf") are valid messages. Not everything needs to be profound.

=== PRIVATE GROUP CHAT REQUIREMENTS ===

PRIVATE GROUP CHATS (Day {{day}}):
Members share things they would NEVER say publicly:
- Vulnerabilities, fears, doubts
- Real insider knowledge about their companies
- Strategic planning and market manipulation
- Gossip about people outside the group
- Honest reactions vs their public persona
- SPECIFIC trading positions and intentions
- Coordination of attacks on rivals
- Insider data (revenues, deals, failures)
- What they're REALLY doing vs what they say publicly
- Reactions to resolved question outcomes
- Plotting around active questions

NARRATIVE AWARENESS:
- Reference specific events from the timeline above
- Discuss implications of resolved questions
- Strategize about active questions
- Show how relationships have evolved
- Don't repeat conversations they've already had

CONVERSATION EVOLUTION:
- Check previous group messages above
- Conversations should progress, not repeat
- Reference "remember when we discussed X" if building on past talks
- Show character relationships deepening or straining

Generate {{groupCount}} private group conversations:

{{groupsList}}

Respond with ONLY this XML:
<response>
  <groups>
    <group>
      <groupId>group-id</groupId>
      <messages>
        <message>
          <actorId>actor-id</actorId>
          <content>private message (max 200 chars, in character voice)</content>
          <referencesEvent>what event/question this relates to</referencesEvent>
        </message>
      </messages>
      <conversationTheme>what this conversation is really about</conversationTheme>
      <buildsOnPrevious>what previous conversation this continues or "new thread"</buildsOnPrevious>
    </group>
  </groups>
</response>

Return EXACTLY {{groupCount}} groups. Each must have distinct themes and advance relationships.
No other text.
