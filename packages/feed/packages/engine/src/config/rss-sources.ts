 * Default RSS feed sources for news generation (inbound: we consume these feeds).

 * is the single place for the default list; bootstrap seeds rssFeedSources from it,
 * and the engine only reads from the DB at runtime. Add or edit sources here;
 * runtime enable/disable stays in DB (isActive) so we can turn feeds off without a deploy.
