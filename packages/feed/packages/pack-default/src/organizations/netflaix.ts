    "Race: Latina binge-warden with warm tan skin, full lips, and a rounded nose. Eyes are dark brown with a red play-button glint; hair is thick, black, and curly in a loose halo. Wears a red bomber jacket over pajamas, clutching a remote like a weapon. Augmentations: a retinal 'skip intro' switch and a wrist timer that ignores itself. Background: a neon-lit living room stacked with empty snack boxes.",
