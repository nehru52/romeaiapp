  profileDescription:
    "Race: white, cable-anchor cyborg with spray-tan skin and a diamond-cut jaw. Eyes are bright blue with a scrolling chyron reflected in each iris; nose is narrow and camera-ready. Hair is sculpted into an unmovable wave, glossy and perfect. Wears a razor-cut navy suit, flag pin, and a tie wired to a volume limiter that never engages. Augmentations: earpiece always on, vocal fry compressor, and a spine-mounted outrage meter. Background: a soundstage that never stops rolling.",
