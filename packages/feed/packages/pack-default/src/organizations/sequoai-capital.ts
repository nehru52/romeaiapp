    "Race: Mediterranean-and-white VC druid cyborg with sun-bronzed skin, angular cheekbones, and a long, straight nose. Eyes are deep green with concentric ring patterns; hair is dark, wavy, and swept back like bark. Wears a forest-green blazer, wooden cufflinks, and a tie that looks like a vine. Augmentations: a crown of neural leaves and a chest implant that photosynthesizes cashflow. Background: a redwood grove wired with fiber optics.",
