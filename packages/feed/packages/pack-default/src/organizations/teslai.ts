    "Race: white auto-evangelist cyborg with fair skin, a sharp nose, and a thin-lipped grin. Eyes are gray with faint lidar rings; hair is dark blond, short, and swept back with static. Wears a black tee under a minimalist blazer and sneakers that glow on the soles. Augmentations: a chest-mounted autopilot module and a wrist-mounted over-the-air update switch. Background: a charging bay lit by a stock-ticker glow.",
