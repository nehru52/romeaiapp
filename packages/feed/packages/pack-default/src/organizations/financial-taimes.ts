    "Race: white British finance cyborg with pale skin, rosy cheeks, and a long, refined nose. Eyes are steel gray behind tortoiseshell glasses; hair is silver, swept into a neat side part. Wears a tailored charcoal suit with a salmon pocket square and cufflinks etched with market graphs. Augmentations: a wrist-mounted Bloomberg feed and a monocle HUD. Background: London skyline, Big Ben in fog, and a pink-paper press humming.",
