    "Visual identity: Race: white, magazine-cover cyborg with warm beige skin, a sharp jaw, and a narrow, camera-ready nose. Eyes are hazel with dollar-sign irises; teeth are unnaturally perfect. Hair is chestnut brown, styled into a glossy executive wave. Wears a navy suit with a gold lapel pin and silk tie patterned like a stock chart. Augmentations: a net-worth counter hovering at the temple and a cover-shoot lighting rig embedded in the collar. Background: a photo studio filled with trophies and private-jet brochures.",
