Eyes are dark, sharp, and slightly bloodshot from late edits; hair is coiled in a short, textured afro. Wears a rumpled blazer over a protest tee, ink-stained cuffs, and round glasses. Augmentations: a red-ink laser pen and a speech-to-text mic embedded in the collar. Background: a newsroom with protest posters and open policy binders.",
