/**
 * Content Quality Gate Unit Tests
 *
 * Tests the write-side quality gate that validates content before DB insertion.
 * The gate runs structure + entity + grounding/coherence checks.
 *
 * Pure unit tests — no DB. Embedding-based grounding degrades gracefully
 * when OPENAI_API_KEY is absent, so these tests exercise the structural
 * and entity layers that run synchronously.
