/**
 * Known API-key prefix patterns — used by the Settings save form to
 * surface inline warnings when the user pastes something that looks
 * wrong (e.g., a model slug like `tencent/hy3-preview` into the
 * OPENROUTER_API_KEY field).
 *
 * Mirrors `KEY_PREFIX_HINTS` in
 * `packages/agent/src/api/plugin-validation.ts` — the server-side
 * version runs at save time and surfaces a warning in the validation
 * result; the client-side version here runs as the user types so they
 * catch the mistake before it lands on disk.
 *
 * Keep both in sync. If a third party plugin needs prefix validation,
 * add it here and to plugin-validation.ts. The duplication is
 * acknowledged-but-bounded for now since the data is small and rarely changes.
