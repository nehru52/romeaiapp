# Security Policy

The elizaOS team takes the security of our software seriously. This
document describes how to report vulnerabilities and our remediation
commitments.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open public GitHub issues for security bugs.**

Email: **security@elizalabs.ai**

Encrypted-report intake is not available until the organization GPG key is
provisioned. The public key and fingerprint will be published at
`https://elizalabs.ai/.well-known/pgp-key.asc` once provisioned (see
*human-in-loop* note below).

We will acknowledge receipt within **2 business days** and provide an initial
triage assessment within **5 business days**.

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow a **90-day** coordinated-disclosure window from initial report to
public disclosure. We may extend this for complex issues by mutual agreement
with the reporter. Researchers who report in good faith and follow this policy
will not be subject to legal action under our vulnerability-disclosure terms.

## Remediation SLA

Once a vulnerability is confirmed:

| Severity (CVSS v3) | Remediation Target  | Notes                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Critical (9.0–10)  | **7 calendar days** | Includes hotfix release where applicable.        |
| High (7.0–8.9)     | **30 days**         | Patched in next minor release.                   |
| Medium (4.0–6.9)   | **90 days**         | Patched in next minor release or bundled bugfix. |
| Low (< 4.0)        | Next planned release| Tracked but not separately released.             |

These targets apply to first-party code in this repository and to direct
dependencies under our control. Transitive vulnerabilities that depend on
upstream maintainers may take longer; we document any extended exposure in
this file and in dependabot ignore rules.

## Supported Versions

Security patches are applied to the **`latest` and `beta` dist-tag releases**
on npm/PyPI. Versions older than the current `latest` minor are end-of-life
and will not receive patches.

## Scope

In-scope:
- Source code in this repository.
- Official installer and deployment scripts shipped from this repository,
  including `packages/homepage/public/install.{sh,ps1}` and
  `packages/deploy/systemd/install.sh`.
- Officially published packages on npm and PyPI.

Out-of-scope:
- Third-party plugins not maintained by the elizaOS organization.
- Social engineering against contributors.
- Denial of service via resource exhaustion of a self-hosted deployment.

## Public Advisories

Confirmed and remediated vulnerabilities are published as GitHub Security
Advisories on this repository.

## Human-in-loop checklist (must be completed before SOC2 audit)

The following items require an operator to provision real values:

- [ ] Generate organization GPG key for `security@elizalabs.ai`, publish public
      key at `https://elizalabs.ai/.well-known/pgp-key.asc`, update fingerprint
      above.
- [ ] Confirm the `security@elizalabs.ai` mailbox is monitored by at least two
      named individuals with paging coverage.
- [ ] Register the security contact on https://securitytxt.org/ and publish
      `/.well-known/security.txt`.
